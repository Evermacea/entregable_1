124074,Argentina,"Concentrated full-force aromas of mixed black fruits come with notes of cheesy oak and animal hide. This is not your usual 15% abv bruiser even though it's full-bodied and burly.

With the extra dollop of Syrah, it's got more substance than the usual Châteauneuf wannabes. Spicy and sharp, this benefits from the fact that the grapes all came in at once and were co-fermented, so the blend married early and well.
