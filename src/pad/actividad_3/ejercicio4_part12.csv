145029,Italy,"Here is a dense and intense Primitivo with exotic spice, clove, ground cinnamon and nutmeg backed by plump red fruit and toasted notes. A very nice ensemble with roundness and harmony and a rock-solid build. Cellar the wine for at least two more years.",Punta Aquila,90,,Southern Italy,Puglia,,,,,Primitivo,Tenute Rubino
145030,Austria,"The Kollmitz's Joching vineyard is at the heart of Erich Machherndl's wines, producing both Riesling and Grüner Veltliner. This Grüner is impressively rich in a smooth, creamy style, with fresh green apples and white currant flavors. It should age well, its richness giving it the right structure.",Smaragd Kollmitz,90,22.0,Wachau,,,,,,Grüner Veltliner,Machherndl
145031,US,"Lots to like in this Cab Franc. Shows ripe, attractive cherry compote, black raspberry purée, cola, cocoa, coffee and spice flavors, with a rich, earthy edge of balsamic, sautéed mushroom and oaky vanilla. Then there are the tannins. They kick in and give the wine a youthful, lively structure. Very nice wine, but be sure to decant it for a few hours.",Reserve,90,19.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,,,,Cabernet Franc,Ironstone
145032,US,"Concentrated and showing a whiff of volatility, this is a blend of 62% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and a splash each of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. Grapes are sourced from three different estate vineyards on Red Mountain. It's acidic and extracted, but opens up with exposure to air into a supple, rich, muscular, raspberry and cherry-flavored red blend. There are hints of rock, fennel and smoke, and a long, concentrated and well-rounded finish.",Three Vineyards,90,22.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Hedges
145033,US,"Dark, dense, ripe and oaky, this ramps up the oak flavors to higher levels, with rich layers of smoke, cedar, honey and butterscotch wrapped into the spicy, sweet fruit. As the wine ages and opens up the lovely cherry/cassis core fruit should come into the spotlight. Call it a Washington take on ripe, high-octane California reds.",Red Mountain,90,50.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,,,,Red Blend,Hightower
145034,Spain,"Sweet and welcoming; a good deal among pedigreed red wines. The nose on this 100% Monastrell from older vines is mammoth, toasty and dark, while the palate is chunky and virtually melts with blackberry, plum and cherry flavors. A real-deal red with breadth and class. 1,000 cases made.",,90,16.0,Levante,Jumilla,,,,,Monastrell,Juan Gil
145035,US,"Here's a dry Chardonnay, notable for its firm structure. Acidity and oak tannins provide the framework for the candied Meyer lemon, mango, floral, mineral and buttered toast flavors. There's a touch of bitterness in the finish that suggests very modest aging. Drink now through 2008.",Quenneville Vineyard,90,35.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Byington
145036,Argentina,"Few Argentinean wineries are doing everyday red wines better than Chakana. A case in point is this excellent, superbly balanced, easy-drinking Cab. The nose is meaty, earthy and magnetic, while the palate is ripe, harmonious and full of cassis and raspberry. It's fruity more than complex, with stature and style.",,90,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chakana
145037,Argentina,"Color, power, flavor and commendable balance; that's pretty much the format for Punto Final, one of Argentina's go-to brands for Malbec. This youngster is ripe and ready, and it holds form onto a long finish. If it seems a little young and clumsy upon pouring, air it out and it'll improve.",Punto Final,90,11.0,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,,,,Malbec,Bodega Renacer
145038,US,"A classic Bordeaux blend (about 30% each Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot, the rest Petite Verdot) This wine is still locked up tight upon release. There is metallic minerality underpinning the tart, austere fruit, but there are also surprising high notes of brandied cherries, and a sense of depth missing in more ordinary wines. This is definitely a wine to cellar for up to a decade. As always, this is sensitive, detailed winemaking.",Ciel du Cheval,90,30.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Seven Hills
145039,US,"This is one of the riper of Siduri's crop of '05 single-vineyard Pinots. It bursts with cherry jam, sweet cola, vanilla and coffee fudge flavors that make it delicious, but it's no mere fruit bomb. The complex of acids, tannins and oak give it dimensions worth pondering. Best now and for five years.",Van der Kamp Vineyard,90,42.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,,,,Pinot Noir,Siduri
145040,US,"This doesn't disappoint. It's a Cabernet-based blend, with Merlot and Syrah. The '03 is lushly soft but dry and rich, with ripe, velvety tannins framing intense blackberry, coffee, tobacco and spice flavors. Should hit its stride by the end of 2007, and glide down for a couple of years after.",Alexis Red Wine,90,64.0,California,Oakville,Napa,,,,Red Blend,Swanson
145041,Austria,"The steep terraced vineyard of the Sonnleiten, perfectly exposed, has produced a tense, vibrant Riesling, showing the mineral side of the grape, along with pink grapefruit and white currant flavors. It will age over many years.",Terrassen Sonnleiten,90,,Neusiedlersee-Hügelland,,,,,,Riesling,R&A; Pfaffl
145042,US,"Easily the richest of Schug's current trio of Chards, showing the elegance and crispness of the other bottlings, but with more fruity intensity. It's still a fairly restrained wine, rich in acidity and dry minerality, but rewards with pineapple custard and butterscotch flavors.",Heritage Reserve,90,30.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Schug
145043,Australia,"Produced by Frankland Estate, this is a full-bodied, richly textured Riesling with aromas and flavors of honey, crushed stone and citrus. It's surprisingly long on the finish. Imported by USA Wine West.",,90,14.0,Western Australia,Frankland River,,,,,Riesling,Rocky Gully
145044,Germany,"A bit fuller and drier than you might expect from a Mosel Riesling, but there's no questioning this wine's excellent balance. Honey and cinnamon notes accent pear and melon fruit, while hints of petrol lurk in the background. It's almost dry on the long finish.",Butterfly,90,16.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,,,,Riesling,Zilliken
145045,US,"Califa is the winery's highest designation, kind of a reserve, and this Syrah is oakier and riper than the regular Chamisal bottling, although fully as dry. Marked with high, minty acidity and firm tannins. But there's huge red and black cherry fruit, courtesy of one of the hottest vintages in Edna Valley history. Elegant and intense, it's ready now.",Chamisal Vineyards Califa,89,42.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,,,,Syrah,Domaine Alfred
145046,US,"A 50/50 Cab/Merlot blend from Pepper Bridge, this is quite tight and reductive but grudgingly opens out. It's a stiff, hard wine, layered with blueberry, raspberry and cassis, and annotated with baker's chocolate and anise. Dark and unyielding, it has the muscle and authority to age for another six or eight years. There's a hint of green tea in the chewy tannins.",Pepper Bridge,89,,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Hightower
145047,Spain,"This muscular youth proves that Priorat can deliver fleshy, modern wines. Or maybe it's the 20% Merlot that's softenening the Garnacha and Carignan. Either way, look for lush plum and black cherry flavors floating on a rich, heady palate. This is more Escalade or Range Rover than sports car.",,89,32.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,,,,Red Blend,Genium Celler
145048,Spain,"Very nice apple blossom and lightly stony aromas greet you, and the apple and apricot flavors are juicy and ripe. This is an all-fruit wine with just enough acidity and minerality to keep it in shape. Finishes with citrus and melon. Drink now.",,89,24.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,,,,Albariño,Lusco
145049,US,"Same vineyards as the '04, but a riper, deeper, denser vintage. This is good Washington merlot, with muscle, extract and plenty of stuffing. Flavors run to the dark side, blue/black fruits, mineral, licorice, smoke. It's got the kind of mass that will stand up to all meats, and the balance to age over the next decade or so. Nicely built, still tight and chewy.",,89,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Merlot,Tamarack Cellars
145050,US,This single-vineyard 100% varietal bottling is too tough and astringent to drink now. It's in need of time to let the tannins dissolve and fall out. The question is whether or not the blackberry flavors are rich enough to survive. My guess is no.,Family Home,85,60.0,California,Oakville,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Source Napa
145051,US,"There's a sharpness to the mouthfeel that gives this an unbalanced bite, and it also finishes a little on the semisweet side. That combination of traits makes this average-quality Pinot taste candied, like a cherry LifeSaver.",Tyler's Block,85,38.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Turner
145052,Italy,"This delivers aromas of black cherry and dark notes of burnt bread that are so sharp, they are almost pungent. The mouthfeel, on the other hand, is clean, smooth and shows good endurance.",Podere Bellarina,85,31.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,,Red Blend,Tenute Niccolai
145053,US,"Juicy and ripe in chocolate-covered currant, blackberry, cherry, licorice and sage flavors, this Cab finishes with a rich coating of soft tannins.",,85,18.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paso Creek
145054,Chile,"Aromas of bitter greens and stony fruits are simple and subdued. The palate deals just one note of lime before finishing with grapefruit. Not a lot going on besides respectable, midlevel citrus. Drink right away.",Reserva,85,13.0,Casablanca Valley,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,MontGras
145055,US,"On opening, the oak on this Carneros Chard was overwhelming in smoke and char, giving the pear, Meyer lemon and kiwi flavors a woody undertow. As it breathes, it softens and unifies, but it's still a Hulk of a wine.",Lot 57,85,12.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Cameron Hughes
145056,Chile,"Mouthfeel is a vital component of any wine, and this one has a very hard, tannic feel to it. The nose is reduced and compact, with sweet cherry and cassis aromas. But as stated, the palate is like nails. It's literally sharp and has poke, and in the end there's nothing to indicate that age will tame the beast. Imported by Orvino Imports.",Limited Edition,85,25.0,Central Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Echeverria
145057,France,"Spicy fruits vie with blackberry flavors in this soft, rounded wine.

145058,France,"A ripe, juicy wine, layering red plums, rhubarb and some spice. There is a warmth here, which goes well with the soft tannins. The finish is fresh and soft.",Shiraz Merlot,85,10.0,France Other,Vin de Pays Vignobles de France,,,,,Shiraz-Merlot,Chamarré
145059,US,"This is pleasant and light, with just 12% alcohol and enough acid to keep the sweetness at some distance. Simple, slightly sweet and citrusy, it is a well-made, widely available, representative bottle of budget Riesling in the Washington style.",Quail Series,85,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Riesling,Covey Run
145060,Chile,"Banana, hazelnut cake and hot alcoholic aromas boost this unoaked wine that weighs in at an oversized 15.1%. Despite its coastal San Antonio address, the wine is quite low in acidity and big in ripe pear, banana and vanilla flavors. “Fluffy” is the word that comes to mind in describing this candied New Worlder.",Unoaked,85,18.0,San Antonio,,,,,,Chardonnay,Amaral
145061,US,"Based on Cabernet with the other four Bordeaux varieties blended in, this wine is in your face with sweetly ripe cassis, cherry, red licorice, cocoa, cola and vanilla flavors. It would benefit from greater subtlety and restraint.",Anthology Red Wine,85,54.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Conn Creek
145062,France,"On the rich side for a Muscadet, with an earthy character, sage and lemongrass flavors touched with gala apple creaminess. This certainly has a riper side than many a Muscadet.",Les Grandes Vignes,85,12.0,Loire Valley,Muscadet Coteaux de la Loire,,,,,Melon,Alliance Loire
145063,South Africa,"Bursting with a nose of lemon and grapefruit, this fresh, lively wine offers good, mouthpuckering Sauvignon Blanc fruit with a racy, clean finish. Food friendly and affordable, it's simple but good.",Reserve Collection,85,12.0,Coastal Region,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Boschendal
145064,Australia,"Marked by slightly herbal, tomato-y elements, this wine is nevertheless well put together, with delicate fruit flavors tinged by mushroomy notes. Offers authentic Pinot flavors at a reasonable price.",Tin Cows,85,18.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,,,,Pinot Noir,TarraWarra
145065,US,"This is a newer vineyard and sometimes the wines can have that fresh, jammy taste you get from young vines that may have been over-cropped. So it is with the '05, a cool vintage whose acidity accentuates the sharpness. The blackberry and cherry flavors are dry, and finish sharp and simple.",La Rinconada Vineyard,85,48.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Sanford
145066,US,"Soft and jammy, this Pinot has pie-filling flavors of cherries, rapsberries and blackberries. In fact, you can throw in the pie crust, too, with its buttery, smoky, vanilla and toasted dough taste. Seems heavy for a coastal Pinot, especially at this price.",,85,49.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,,,,Pinot Noir,Amici
145067,Chile,"A lot of roughness and herbal character require patience and forgiveness. There's tree bark, cola and a strong leafy character to both the nose and palate of this Merlot, which shows classic Chilean olive and peppery notes on the finish along with a good mouthfeel.",,85,20.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,,,,Merlot,Arboleda
145068,Chile,"Almost amber in color, with both fresh orange and drier orange peel on the nose. This is a solid effort with flavors of honey, apple cider and caramel. It could use another shot of acidity to give it a more balanced mouthfeel, but still it's a nice and pleasant wine.",Late Harvest Reserva,85,15.0,Curicó Valley,,,,,,Gewürztraminer,Aresti
145069,France,"Firmly dry, with mineral austerity from the core of classic Bordeaux tannins. The acidity, the black currant fruits and the flavor of licorice and bitter chocolate are all there.",Réserve Bordeaux Tradition,85,12.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Chamarré
145070,US,"This is straightforward and crisp, showing apple and melon, a hint of baking spice and a tart, acidic finish.",,85,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Chardonnay,Cascadia
145071,Chile,"Fairly sweet berry and cassis aromas mix with some heat and alcohol, and then things settle down as bright but mildly rubbery cherry, cassis and raspberry fruit takes over. It's a little astringent and stretched out, but it doesn't try to do too much and thus is easy end enjoyable. Imported by Orvino Imports.",Reserva,85,13.0,Molina,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Echeverria
145072,US,"This pleasant effort sends up sweet notes of honeysuckle and orange blossom, spreading broadly across the palate with flavors of juicy peach, nectarine and spice. It's a bit dull in the nose, and tails off in the finish.",Cellarmaster's,85,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Riesling,Columbia Winery
145073,US,"Shows real Central Coast character in the zesty acidity that makes this Chard so bright. With jammy pineapple, Meyer lemon, kiwi and fig flavors, it also has forward oak influences. Lots going on in this fresh young wine.",Selected Vineyards,85,10.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Concannon
145074,US,"Hogue's lowest-priced Chard is reliably clean fruit and appley, with firm acids and no frills. It does have some snap to the acids, a characteristic of Washington Chardonnay, and that sets it up for a food-friendly finish.",,85,9.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Chardonnay,Hogue
145075,US,"This brash, lusty, immature Zin is brimming with fresh acids and primary blackberry, cherry and blueberry flavors. This is a wine that will benefit from another year of age.",Old Vine,85,12.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,,,,Zinfandel,Gnarly Head
145076,Chile,"Tasted twice with similar findings, this comes out in the wash as a sweet, lumbering Chardonnay. There's a ton of cream and body to it, with soft pineapple and melon flavors. There's no denying that it's full and honeyed, but it's missing the password to fuller harmony, namely brighter acidity. The 14.9% alcohol listed on the label tells you something.",Cuvée Alexandre Atalayas Vineyard,85,24.0,Casablanca Valley,,,,,,Chardonnay,Lapostolle
145077,South Africa,"A very pretty, balanced nose of fresh fruit and flowers, and a flavor profile of good, balanced strawberry fruit and acidity make this wine suitable for everyday drinking and pairing with salads, poultry and fresh fruit. Not terribly complex but tasty for this price. Imported by Cape Wine Ventures, LLC.",Rosé,85,8.0,Western Cape,,,,,,Pinotage,Tall Horse
145078,US,"This aging Merlot is already showing mature flavors; the fruit is dropping away and leaving rather astringent tannins. Right now you've got a mix of plum, blueberry and cherry fruit, softened up but still present, so it's time to drink it up.",,85,20.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Merlot,Wineglass Cellars
145079,US,"Great crunchy acidity and 10.5% residual sugar go a long way to making this unoaked white dessert wine pleasantly drinkable. The wine has orange, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors.",Moscato Allegro,85,12.0,California,California,California Other,,,,White Blend,Martin & Weyrich
145080,US,"Almost indistinguishable from Beringer's Chabot bottling, perhaps a bit more aromatic and softer in tannins. Flavors range from cassis and black cherry through dark chocolate and dill. Drinkable now with rich foods, but will gain in sweetness and complexity with a few years of cellaring.",St. Helena Home Vineyard,92,80.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
145081,US,"A real find. French in style, dry, rich and elegant. Hints of cherry and cassis are wrapped in thick, fine tannins, and the mouthfeel is sensual and velvety. Delicious now, but should hold through the decade. Grapes from Yorkville Highlands. The winemaker is the well-known Kerry Damsky.",,92,36.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Le Vin
145082,Italy,"A big, rich, Port-like Brunello that found controversy with our panel. While some admired it for its ripeness, others felt it a bit raisiny. Regardless, all agreed that it possesses intense concentration, a creamy mouthfeel and a long, softly tannic finish.",,92,65.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,,,,Sangiovese,Fuligni
145083,US,"An extraordinary wine. From the cooler west side of the appellation, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah offers a little something from each variety. The overall effect is a concerto, vibrant and complex. Huge oak, but the expressive fruit wears it well. Beautiful tannins coat the palate like a mink coat.",L'Adventure Estate Cuvée,92,75.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,,,,Red Blend,Stephan Ridge
145084,Portugal,"This lushly fruity Port folds in enough intriguing floral aromas to be more than a simple fruit bomb. Briary notes add another element to the creamy boysenberry flavors that are incredibly rich but not cloying or syrupy. Likely to mature early but hold well, thanks to masses of supple tannins. Great quality for the price.",Vintage Porto,92,45.0,Douro,,,,,,Port,Quinta do Vale Meão
145085,US,"Pours inky black, and smells young and backward. Lots of airing reveals blackberry jam, with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and toast. Drinks soft, velvety, luscious and complex. Good berry fruit is supported by firm, dry tannins. Lovely now, and best consumed in the next year or so to capture its vibrant youth.",,92,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Phoenix
145086,Italy,"This wine really grows on you. It starts off with slightly acrid, coarse elements of briar patch and weeds, but it explodes on the palate, turning rich, chocolaty and refined. Deep layers of softly tannic, plum-flavored fruit caress the mouth, leaving a lasting aftertaste.",Altero,92,57.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,,,,Sangiovese,Poggio Antico
145087,Italy,"Satisfying and delicious at every point. The bouquet is lovely; it delivers dense plum fruit, chili-like spice and mounds of wet earth. The palate is pure blackberry and dark plum, and it finishes smooth as silk, with just enough coarseness to add texture and grit. Firm but not hard. A definite winner from Abruzzo. Drink by the end of 2004.",Ursonia,91,39.0,Central Italy,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,,,,,Montepulciano,Il Feuduccio Di S. Maria D'Orni
145088,US,"When this wine was first produced it was a blend of three Bordeaux varietals, but longtime winemaker Ken Deis has since expanded his palate. This year's version is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with some Cabernet Franc and Malbec. A young, dense wine with significant tannins, it is marked by an overlay of well-charred oak, but the core of cassis suggests ageability.",Trilogy,91,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Meritage,Flora Springs
145089,US,"Pretty tannic, a wine that makes the tongue stick to the palate, although it will soften and sweeten up with big, rich roasts. Underlying flavors are of blackberries, currants and tobacco, and the finish is very dry. Seems to have the density and concentration to cellar for the long haul.",Quarry Vineyard,91,80.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
145090,Italy,"Rich, smoky, pure and encouraging from the first take all the way to the back end. There's lots of zest and spunk to this racy yet round Chianti. The palate is full of blackberry and the feel is supple. It's totally ripe and tannic, with notes of vanilla, chocolate and espresso forming the base. Oaky but integrated; modern but traditional enough.",,91,20.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,,,,Sangiovese,Carpineto
145091,Portugal,"Starts off a bit floral and toasty, but the blueberry-scented fruit quickly asserts itself. Masses of soft, ripe fruit come through on the palate, along with a rich, dense, mouthfeel and soft but plentiful tannins.",,91,43.0,Dão,,,,,,Touriga Nacional,Casa de Santar
145092,US,"Pours dark, and opens with aromas of cassis and smoky oak and vanilla, suggesting a very young wine. Enters with smooth, gorgeous tannins and a rich, velvety mouthfeel that carries along flavors of blackberry nectar that explode mid-palate. This crescendo tapers off in the long finish, where the young, ripe tannins show up. Age through 2010.",,91,46.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sawyer Cellars
145093,US,"There must have been severe vineyard selection for this wine, for it rises above the vintage to achieve real intensity and concentration. Cassis, blackcurrants and cherry flavors are enhanced with a touch of menthol and a lot of oak to produce a lavish, complex mouthfeel. The tannins are a work of art, lush and soft.",Beckstoffer Vineyards Clone Six,91,75.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Merryvale
145094,US,"Stays true to the CDV style of crafting wines that tend to be tough in their youth, but are solidly built for the long haul. Good, rich blackcurrant fruit is folded into thick tannins. Stick it in your cave and come back to it in a few years.",Oak Vineyard,91,62.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos du Val
145095,Portugal,"Effectively a 25-year-old tawny, this wine starts off slowly, with restrained aromas of nuts and dried fruit. Then it caresses the palate with silky, lush, honeyed flavors of walnuts, oranges, cinnamon and clove, building to a crescendo on the long, anise-tinged finish.",Colheita Bottled 2002,91,75.0,Port,,,,,,Port,Barros
145096,US,"An extremely tannic and tough wine that numbs the palate despite polished plum, blackberry and dry chocolate flavors. Oak adds vanilla, smoke and a richly creamy texture. Will it age? The compact berry-cherry flavors suggest yes. Try again in 10 years.",Chabot Vineyard,91,80.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
145097,Italy,"The nose of this Sangiovese-Merlot is muscular and broad, with a hint of earth and mushroom sneaking in between the folds of deep red fruit. More robust fruit fills out the palate, while it finishes long and chocolaty, with notes of coffee. Quite sturdy and eminently satisfying.",RosSole,91,28.0,Tuscany,Chianti,,,,,Sangiovese,Borgo Salcetino
145098,Portugal,"Luis Pato's Bairradas used to be the standouts of the D.O. In a sense they still are, although he has chosen to label them with the regional denomination of Beiras in protest over restrictive practices. In this example, Pato has harnessed the rough tannins and brash acidity of Baga into a rich creamy wine filled with blackberries and anise. It's still tannic and crisp, but it just needs another 10 years in the cellar to become fully appreciable.",Quinta do Moinho Baga,91,60.0,Beiras,,,,,,Baga,Luis Pato
145099,Italy,"Deep and ripe; once inside, you'll find a jumpy blend of ripe black stone fruits laid over a leathery texture. On the finish, coffee and toast offer darkness and coarseness. Firm tannins suggest a few years more aging.",,91,70.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,,,,Sangiovese,Poderi Brizio
145100,Italy,"Round and ripe, with woody hints, a note of bramble patch and plenty of saturated red fruit. Flavors of plum, berry, pepper and espresso drive the palate, followed by light oak and butter on the finish. Well structured and well made, it's another fine super Tuscan from the top-shelf 1999 vintage.",Balifico,91,46.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,,Sangiovese,Volpaia
145101,US,"Pretty tannic, and extremely well-oaked. Char, vanilla and smoke dominate the opening aroma, only gradually revealing underlying cassis flavors. In the mouth, the wine is tannic and young, but the solid core of cherry-berry suggests aging until 2008.",State Lane,91,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
145102,US,"At first this is very woody, bordering on sappy. But with time the wood softens, leaving ripe and bright cassis, plum and black cherry. The finish is toasty and creamy. And while it feels full and hearty, the wine isn't hard or tannic. An interesting blend of Cabernet, Sangiovese and Petite Sirah.",,91,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Red Blend,Bacio Divino
145103,US,"A very fine Cabernet, the kind you like to think you'd instantly identify in a blind tasting as superior Napa. It has ripe flavors of cassis and blackcurrants, and fabulously rich, dry, complicated tannins that glide across the palate with velvety smoothness. Oak contributes the usual vanilla and smoke to this delectable kosher wine.",Special Reserve,91,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Herzog
145104,US,"This Merlot/Cabernet blend (hence, Mernet) serves up fairly exuberant aromas. It's quite smoky and rich, full-bodied, with big, ripe tannins and layers of cassis, blackberry, anise, toast and coffee flavors. Long at the end.",Mernet,91,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Keenan
145105,US,"From vineyards quite high up in the eastern mountains, this wine is from stressed, low-yielding grapes. The blackberry and cassis flavors are concentrated and dense, and the tannins are tough and firm. Oak plays a supporting role. Rich foods, such as lamb or gongonzola cheese, will soften and sweeten it, but you're best off cellaring for a few years.",Alden Vineyards,91,30.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
145106,Italy,"Spicy and bold at first, and then it evolves to display earth, trail dust and flower-petal aromas. Juicy in the mouth due to bright acids that prop up healthy fruit. The tannins are mammoth, but with a fine steak or breast of duck, they'll sing. Quite a nice surprise from a property in the midst of a renaissance.",Coltassala Riserva,91,46.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,,,,Sangiovese,Volpaia
145107,US,"Laurel Glen's second wine, and no slouch. This vintage brings a richly textured, deeply flavored Cab as good as many costing far more. Ripe flavors of currants are wrapped in toasty oak, with firm but plush tannins. Will age through the decade and improve.

145108,Australia,"Big and black, with complex aromas and flavors of earth, tobacco, coffee and dark plums that hit you hard and pump out the bass notes all the way through the finish.

145109,US,"Quite as tannic as Beringer's other limited-release single-vineyard Cabs, although a streak of buttery softness makes it drinkable now. Richly marbled with cassis, dark chocolate and cherry flavors, and very dry. Seems to have the depth and structure for the long haul. Try after 2006.",Tre Colline,91,80.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
145110,US,"Rochioli's winemaker has crafted a fine, silky Pinot. The flavors veer toward red cherries and cola, with an edge of sweet oak, while acidity is tart. The wine finishes sharp, but should soften and improve with five to seven years in the cellar.",Rochioli Vineyard,90,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,,Pinot Noir,Castalia
145111,US,"Richer than the '02, this single-vineyard Chard is crisp and bright in acidic structure, with oak and lees to add complexity.

145113,Australia,"So delicate that it, at times, seems fleeting. There are pineapple and spice aromas, and white peach joins in on the palate. What's most remarkable is the feel—one minute it feels full, and the next, like dust blowing in the wind. Changing in the glass, and by the sip. Good for the soul.

145114,New Zealand,"The U.S. pricing for this wine is a bit extravagant, but the wine delivers wonderful spicy and savory aromas, backed by loads of cherries, a creamy mouthfeel and hints of vanilla briars and spice.

145115,New Zealand,"Smells fresh enough to make your mouth water, filled with scents of lime zest and green apples. On the palate, it's nicely balanced, not as rich or sweet as a tank sample of the '05, but crisp and elegant, with superb concentration.",,90,24.0,Waipara,,,,,,Riesling,Pegasus Bay
145116,Australia,"Toast and black pepper aromas are deep and broad.

145120,US,"I like this wine for its appealing softness and overall lusciousness. It's Paso at its red-wine best, showing cherry and cassis flavors balanced by a rich earthiness. It's totally dry, but so sweet in fruit, it's irresistible. Super value.",,89,10.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,,,,Merlot,Grayson
145121,US,"What a delightful wine. It's low in alcohol but completely dry, with acidity that thoroughly cleanses the palate.

145122,US,"With three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon and the balance Syrah, this Cali-Rhône blend sure is a good wine.

145125,US,"If you love those big, rich, gooey Central Coast Chards, you'll enjoy this one.

145128,New Zealand,"Relatively light in color, but long on flavor, this is a light-bodied, silky wine that comes across as very Burgundian.

Imported by Tasman Wine Selections.",,89,39.0,Central Otago,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Mount Edward
145129,France,"Mumm's flagship Champagne is hugely improved. There is richness, flavors of white peaches and orange peel and just a touch of softness balanced by good structure.

145130,US,"The vineyard is on the border of Sonoma Valley and Carneros, and this complex Cab shows signs of warm and cool influences.

It's not an ager, so drink now.",Rhinefarm Vineyard,89,32.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gundlach Bundschu
145131,US,"There seems to be a great deal of new oak here, to judge by the fresh, strong aromas of vanilla, cedar and smoky char, but those scents mesh well with the cassis, mocha, peat and anise that come from fruit. There's also a leathery thing going on, a little sweaty, but it adds a spicy complexity.",Estate,89,43.0,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,,,,Merlot,Chalk Hill
145132,France,"This four-year-old bottling (indicated on the back label) is a rich Champagne, with some toasty maturity but also flavors of almonds, white currants and citrus peel.

145137,France,"Almost bone dry, this Champagne can be difficult to appreciate, layered with acidity and green fruit. But get beneath its dryness and the fruit is surprisingly ripe, with pink grapefruit flavors. This is a wine that demands bottle aging to soften the acidity, so an indication of disgorgement would be helpful. Imported by Laurent-Perrier.",Ultra Brut Nature,89,49.0,Champagne,Champagne,,,,,Champagne Blend,Laurent-Perrier

145139,US,"Much work evidently went into crafting this wine. It's intense in black currant flavors, with a beautiful polish of chocolate and green olive. The tannins are softly rich.

145140,US,"A fabulous white Rhone blend of enormous complexity and charm. Fills the mouth with butterscotch, creme brulee, pineapple, stony mineral, vanilla, impossibly ripe white peach and creamy hazelnut flavors, and as sweet as that sounds, the wine is dry and crisp.

145141,France,"Blonde de Seigneur was first produced by Georges Vernay in 2000. It is a wine which shows up elegance rather than power, great black fruit expression with fine tannins. It has some dry tannic structure, but there is plenty of fruit here, perfumed and with layers of smoky wood. A really great wine from a medium vintage.",Blonde de Seigneur,94,55.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,,,,Syrah,Domaine Georges Vernay
145142,US,"Wonderfully rich and decadent in botrytis and fruit, just bursting with apricot jam, orange liqueur, honey, vanilla and smoky oak flavors.

Totally addictive with vanilla ice cream.",Late Harvest,94,25.0,California,Mendocino Ridge,Mendocino/Lake Counties,,,,White Riesling,Greenwood Ridge
145143,France,"This is a great, generous wine, packed with dark fruit and tannins. It comes from a well-drained vineyard on the slopes of the hill of Hermitage. There's dry tannins, but they are overwhelmed by the huge spice, herbal,    and blackberry jelly flavors. It should age well over 10-20 years.",Le Méal,94,80.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,,,,Syrah,Ferraton Pere et Fils
145144,US,"A delicious dessert wine, dark ruby in color, and super-aromatic with caramelized  wood, blackcurrant, chocolate and vanilla notes.

145145,France,"Condrieu doesn't have to be overpowering, as Vernay, a master of Viognier, demonstrates in this wine.

It seems to last for ever in the mouth.",Les Terrasses de l'Empire,94,60.0,Rhône Valley,Condrieu,,,,,Viognier,Domaine Georges Vernay
145146,France,"An amazingly perfumed wine, which shows great tannins and ripe fruit. It has a fine structure, packed with smoky wood and blackberry flavors.

145147,France,"The Bessards vineyard is right at the heart of the Hermitage hill. Delas only makes this wine in top years (no 2002, for example), and the quality shows in the aromas of black fruits and violets, the flavors of huge, dense fruit and powerful tannins. This is serious wine, which promises at least 10 years of aging.",Les Bessards,93,122.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,,,,Syrah,Delas Frères
145148,US,"This is a big wine for folks who like to age their Cabs.

145149,US,"A classic Napa Cab from this great vintage. Mesmerizes with new oak, blackcurrant and cassis aromas, and the first sip explodes with blackberries, cherries and vanilla.

145150,US,"Say hello to this marvelously ripe, cheerful Zin. It totally turns you on. The marvelously ripe flavors range from sweet cherries to a baked blackberry tart dusted with cinnamon and cocoa, and finished with a bite of fig. Soft, unctuous tannins, rich acids, total balance.

145151,US,"Impresses for its ripely sweet flavors that mass in the mouth and wash across the palate in waves. Currants, cassis, cherries, coffee, vanilla, smoky oak, you name it.

145152,US,"Almost evenly divided between Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this is a big mountain wine, filled with the flavors of ripe blackberries, blueberries and oak.

145153,US,"This is certainly a wine to lay down. It has a marvelous core of blackcurrant and cherry fruit, and the oak is sweet, but the grip hits mid-palate, and the tannins close everything down on the finish.

145154,France,"A very young wine, with great ripe red fruit flavors, from this single parcel wine. At this stage, when it is all fruit, the tannins, the acidity and the wood flavors are submerged.

145156,Italy,"Who knew Carignan could be this nice? After an initial blast of earth and alcohol subside, what's left is a model Sardinian red with intoxicating cola, lemon peel, herb and deep-fruit aromas.

145159,France,"Albrecht made only 25 cases of this SGN, but if you can find it, it's worth a try. Aromas of caramelized orange peel and ripe melon suggest sweetness--and the wine is sweet--just not dessert-sweet. It's oily and viscous on the palate, conveying an impression of great weight and richness along with flavors of dried spices and citrus. Pair with foie gras or cheeses.",Sélection de Grains Nobles,92,67.0,Alsace,Alsace,,,,,Pinot Gris,Lucien Albrecht

145162,US,"Botrytis has done its thing in the residual sugar (9.3 percent) and heavy apricot jam flavors in this wine.

Merits its high score, and would do even better with a bit more concentration of taste.",Late Harvest Violetta,92,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,White Riesling,Grgich Hills
145163,US,"Quite a different wine from Laetitia's Colline bottling, although it's not fair to say one's better. This is chunkier, with berry and stone fruit flavors intrigued by a meaty, leathery note. It's also more tannic and, for the moment, less accessible, although a tenderloin of beef will deal with that. Probably an ager. Drink now through 2008.",Les Galets,92,60.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Laetitia
145164,US,"Classically proportioned, and drinkable now for its sweet oak, luscious blackcurrant fruit and immediate appeal.

145165,US,"This is a masculine Pinot, deep in color and muscular, but elegant. Think Armani.

145166,US,"Easy to drink for its soft richness, yet complex in structure, this well-oaked wine has ripe flavors of cherry liqueur, black raspberries and white chocolate, with a peppery, spicy finish.

145168,US,"The name refers to a small section of vineyard planted in 1975, in the heart of a mini-banana belt in the area. It's a gorgeous looking wine, that breathes class and elegance. Well-defined cranberry, raspberry and cherry fruit flavors come to a focused middle; it's a high-wire style, still young and fresh, but certainly ageworthy.

145169,France,"There's a hint of kerosene to this wine's ripe, yet minerally, aromas.

145173,France,"Angludet is the story of an estate that has been built up painstakingly over several decades. The Sichels, whose family home this is, make very satisfying wines, which are always good values.

145184,Spain,"A blend of four white grapes, including Albariño; this is an unconventional wine made in small quantities. Starts with cinnamon and anise aromas that morph toward curry.

145186,Italy,"Attractive apricot, peach and honey aromas vie with a strong dosing of oak on the bouquet. Second and third takes, however, unveil additional smoky nuances.

145192,France,"A big, rich wine that is dominated by wood and ripe fruit.

145193,US,"There's a good Pinot in here waiting to get out, and three or four years may do it.

145197,Spain,"More mature and minerally than most, with some earthy notes as well as a sharp smokiness. Apple, citrus and grapefruit flavors dominate the developed, smooth-textured palate. Nice overall, with good body. A stand-up cava.",Jaume de Codorniú Brut,89,,Catalonia,Cava,,,,,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu
145198,France,"With its serious dry style, this is a solid, firmly tannic wine with dry, smoky black fruits and good concentration. It will age well, and shows that this estate is right back in good form.",,89,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Grand Corbin-Despagne
145199,Italy,"Fragrantly sweet, with lush, candied aromas of lime lollipops and jelly doughnuts. The palate holds onto that sweetness as it offers ripe apple, pear and pink grapefruit.

145200,Australia,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon wine shows why Cab is the grape that made Coonawarra famous. Dense and Port-like in color, the full nose displays cassis, fruit, leather, tobacco, green olive and eucalyptus. Rich and supple on the palate, it still has plenty of backbone. The extracted black cherry flavors, accented by green olive, sun-dried tomato and mint, sit atop some firm tannins. It finishes long, but a little hard, and could use a few years in the cellar.",,89,27.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Punters Corner
145201,Italy,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is big, burly and very young, showing some rough aromas of burnt rubber or asphalt at first, but later evolving to reveal firm black-cherry fruit and licorice. The weight of the wine shows admirable extraction and richness, and the powdery tannins hint at a long and positive evolution.",Monsordo Rosso,89,38.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,,,,Cabernet Blend,Ceretto
145202,Italy,"On the nose, it begins with a complex, intoxicating mix of bright floral notes and a little banana. After a few minutes, citrusy aromas sneak in.

145203,South Africa,"A crisp, unwooded wine, at once tangy and full. Citrus, melon and herb aromas lead into a palate that pops with sweet and sour orange-pineapple fruit and clove accents. Despite the lean profile, it even has a buttery note. Refreshingly clean Chardonnay.",Bon Vallon,89,10.0,Robertson,,,,,,Chardonnay,De Wetshof
145204,Italy,"The name of the wine and the grape is Falanghina. It was well liked by Pliny, Horace and Virgil—and who could argue with them? Clean and fresh, this rendition opens with pineapple, banana, citrus and pear scents. The palate displays vibrant acidity, excellent balance, medium body and a velvety mouthfeel. The finish is long and echoes the opening notes. Editors' Choice.",Falanghina Sannio,89,15.0,Southern Italy,Campania,,,,,White Blend,Feudi di San Gregorio
145205,US,"Ripe, tangy pineapple fruit plays nicely against rich butterscotch and maple syrup notes in this attractive white. On the palate, the flavors turn more to green apple and pear, with chalk and lemon providing tension and interest.

145206,Italy,"Creamy, with milk-chocolate and vanilla aromas and flavors alongside strawberries, cherries and tobacco.

145207,Australia,"Racy yet refined, this blend of 76% Cabernet Sauvignon and 24% Merlot shows a good, restrained balance of acid and tannins.

145214,Australia,"Darkly colored and flavored, this Merlot shows lots of toasty oak wrapped around a core of berry and black plum flavors. The mouthfeel is even and smooth, but the spicy finish turns a bit woody, picking up a dry, tart edge as the oak takes over. Tastes rather like a Cabernet, with its dark hue and flavor range.",Orange Vineyard,89,26.0,New South Wales,Orange,,,,,Merlot,Rosemount
145215,Australia,"This even, fairly full Riesling has fragrant, grapey nose and lots of ripe apple-grape fruit.

145217,South Africa,"Another strong showing by Boschendahl, the 1999 Sauvignon Blanc offers grapefruit, smoke and melon aromas.

It's full-flavored, and finishes spicy and a little sweet. Best Buy.",Diamond Label,88,10.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Chardonnay,Rosemount
145220,US,"This mid-weight Chardonnay offers some complexity, with spicy and leesy notes accenting the apple-pear fruit.

145221,Australia,"Very classic Riesling in a Mosel style with green apple, hay and herb and a hint of petrol on the nose.

145223,Australia,"A creamy but not mushy mouthfeel and nicely defined flavors mark this friendly, easy-to-enjoy bottling. It's mainstream, with mild tropical fruit and citrus aromas and flavors, but it has a bit more class than many similar wines, especially with its even feel and long finish. Best Buy.",Wattle Park,88,10.0,South Australia,South Australia,,,,,Chardonnay,Tatachilla
145224,Italy,"This is a full-bodied, bracing tart-cherry bomb with very attractive cedar, tobacco and graphite accents.

Closes long with some tannic bite and dry cherry cedar-toast notes.",Cà del Pazzo,88,33.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,,Sangiovese,Caparzo
145225,Italy,"The mix in this deep, ruby purple- colored wine is 60% Gaglioppo and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. The structure is of good weight, and is round and finely balanced. Initially reticent with its aromatics, after breathing, the wine opens with a deep cherry, dry fruit and woody bouquet. The flavors continue into the long finish where earthy nuances then appear. This one needs some patience.",Gravello,88,29.0,Southern Italy,Calabria,,,,,Gaglioppo,Librandi
145226,Australia,"Burge's allusion is to the trio of Grenache, Shiraz and Mourvèdre that he blends together in this wine, not to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Sweet, jammy aromas of crushed cherries laced with caramel pick up some creamy and cedary notes with airing, then cinnamon and red-earth and iron-mineral flavors spice up the palate. A bit tart on the finish, but this should smooth out over the next year. Will then drink well for five or more years.",The Holy Trinity,88,33.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,,,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Grant Burge
145227,Italy,"With its deep, tart-sweet black-plum aromas and flavors wrapped in a toasty oak blanket, this is an appealing, modern-style Barbera. The grape's native acidity is well tamed, but enough remains to make it a great food match. Has good tannic structure, yet has immediate appeal. Finishes long, dark and handsome.",Annunziata,88,17.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,,,,Barbera,Rocche Castamagna
145228,South Africa,"The bouquet of this Cabernet-Shiraz-Merlot-Ruby Cabernet blend shows intriguing berry, mint, anise, earth and tobacco-herb aromas.

145229,Italy,"More enthusiasts should stretch their horizons and try wines like this engaging Northeastern Italian white. Orange and mineral aromas give way to a dry, even palate in this tasty, medium-weight wine. Good acidity and a slight spiciness on the finish make this a great food wine and an unusual white. Worth the hunt.",Tocai Italiano,88,13.0,Veneto,Lison-Pramaggiore,,,,,Tocai,Tenuta Teracrea
145230,Italy,"Always a bit funky and unusual, this blend of 70% Catarrotto, a native Sicilian white grape, and 30% Chardonnay is mildly viscous but still quite fresh. It offers a medium-weight mouthfeel and a good amount of apple-driven flavor. Not hugely complex, but works as an apéritif or with fettucine Alfredo, baked salmon or grilled veggies. And as reliably out of the mainstream as it is, it's also a perennial value. Give it a shot; there's nothing not to like about it.",Casalj,87,11.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,,,,White Blend,Tenuta Rapitalà
145231,Australia,"Cinnamon-clove aromas on the nose. The wine has dry tannins in the mouth, and very solid, taut cherry and plum fruit, with dusty pencil-eraser accents. Would pair well with grilled food, or just about anything in barbecue sauce.",,87,12.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,,,,Shiraz,Red Knot
145232,Chile,"Fresh off the boat, this youthful SB pitches a no-hitter's worth of pungent grapefruit, passion fruit, cucumber and thistle. Seems to be shooting for the New Zealand style, but it's true-blue Casablanca Sauvignon. Crisp as stones and zesty, with a hint of pickle on the finish.",Reserva,87,12.0,Casablanca Valley,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Santa Rita
145233,US,"A pretty wine, spicy and rich, with an array of vibrantly fruity flavors ranging from sweet citrus through apples and peaches to exotic mango. Winemaker bells and whistles such as barrel fermentation and lees add creamy, vanilla, buttered toast notes.",,87,16.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Benziger
145234,US,"In attempting to reach for just a bit of extra flavor the wine has gone slightly over the top, but offers many near-term pleasures. A plush mix of stewed fruits, sweet plum and mince pie smoothes into a seductive, lush middle before hitting a wall of tannin on the way out.",Pepper Bridge Vineyard,87,25.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Merlot,Boudreaux Cellars
145235,Australia,"Very light yellow in the glass, with light floral/fresh meadow aromas to match. White meat and pear fruit is weighty on the front palate, and fades into a bright herbal-steeliness on the finish. Not hugely fat or mouthcoating. It's just the right size, and rather interesting at that.",Hunter Valley,87,20.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,,,,Chardonnay,De Bortoli
145236,US,"A nice Cab that mingles its polished berry-cherry flavors with earthy tobacco and mocha to make for a dry, very drinkable wine.",OFS,87,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,De Loach
145237,US,"There's a firm structure to the fruit, which is elaborate in plummy, blackberry and mocha flavors. Will hold for a few years, but it's best to drink it in its youthful freshness.",,87,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Deerfield Ranch
145238,Austria,"Grüner Veltliner is Austria's own special white—it's fresh, but peppery, aromatic, spicy and flowery. This example has all those flavors, and is a bargain, too. It comes from one of the world's great cooperatives. The fruit comes from the terraced vineyards of the Wachau region in the Danube Valley. The term “Federspiel” is used in the Wachau to denote a good everyday wine, and this is exactly that.",Federspiel Terrassen,87,13.0,Wachau,,,,,,Grüner Veltliner,Domäne Wachau
145239,Italy,"Starts off nicely, with aromatic notes of cinnamon, graham cracker and mint. There's some solid cherry fruit in the mouth, but it gets a little swamped by oaky notes of cedar and vanilla, finishing with soft tannins and tart acids. The barrique-aged blend is approximately 50% Nebbiolo, 40% Barbera and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Monprà,87,59.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,,,,Red Blend,Conterno Fantino
145240,Australia,"This reasonably priced Riesling shows trading-card bubblegumpowder and white peach aromas. Firm white peach and citrus flavors are couched in a round, amply sized feel. A very good wine, from an always reliable producer.",Magnus,87,12.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,,,,Riesling,Leasingham
145241,Australia,"With such abyss-deep black aromas (steak, pepper, licorice) the palate, by not knocking you out with giant tannins and lots of charred oak, feels slender in comparison. This is a pleasing balance of smooth tannins, and pretty black plum and blueberry flavors.",Patterson Hill,87,40.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Limb
145242,Italy,"Solid, with restrained red fruit, tea, fallen leaves and leather on the nose. Old school all the way, with raspberry and black cherry flavors and little to no perceivable oak. It expands nicely on the finish, offering a glance into the lighter style of Chianti.",Isassi,87,16.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,,,,Sangiovese,Melini
145243,Argentina,"Dense and dark, with a color akin to purple ink. Catchy, well-made, the fruit is ripe and abnormally friendly, while the structure is solid. What makes this an above-average wine in its class is that the acidity is mellow, not shrill as is often the case.",Pircas Vineyard,87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,,,,Bonarda,Mayol
145244,Italy,"Burnt-match aromas meld with burnt coffee on the nose, lending a slightly off note to this otherwise very fine wine. Black cherry and mushroom flavors are wrapped in a soft, supple package that reflects the great ripeness achieved in the 2000 vintage.",Cerequio,87,85.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,,,,Nebbiolo,Michele Chiarlo
145245,South Africa,"Bright, focused classic orange-apricot Muscat aromas and flavors shine in this fortified wine from Paarl. Though light in feel, it shows a little heat—no surprise with its 18% alcohol. Refreshing very cold from the nose right through the tangy citrus-spice close.",Jerepico,87,15.0,Paarl,,,,,,Morio Muskat,Landskroon
145246,France,"The heat-drenched 2003 vintage has given this wine far more weight and flesh than is typical. Although this may turn off some Muscadet fans, it gives folks who haven't yet discovered Muscadet a relatively easy introduction to the genre. It's filled with soft stone fruit and melon flavors, but it still retains the briny, minerally soul of its appellation and a lingering finish.",,87,10.0,Loire Valley,Muscadet Sèvre et Maine,,,,,Muscadet,Domaine de la Pepière
145247,US,"This one's super-dry and tight in acids and displays citrus flavors. You might think it was Sauvignon Blanc, except for the peacock's tail of white peach and mango on the finish. A great food wine.",,87,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Viognier,Stags' Leap Winery
145248,Italy,"Light and open, but with purity and more power than normal. Starts with lime and citrus pith and finishes with grip, an acid wave, and some white pepper. Long on the back end for Orvieto, and well made.",,87,13.0,Central Italy,Orvieto Classico Superiore,,,,,White Blend,Salviano
145249,US,"Cherry, berry and herb flavors are buried inside bigtime tannins that numb the palate, in this dry, smoothly textured wine. It's questionable whether the wine has enough stuffing for the cellar.",Alden Perry Reserve,87,48.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,,,,Red Blend,Napa Redwoods Estate
145250,US,"This reliable producer makes a pleasant, lightweight but solid, mainstream Merlot. The fruit is on the strawberry/red currant end of the spectrum, light but flavorful. It's dusted with cocoa/baking chocolate barrel flavors.",,87,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Merlot,Waterbrook

145253,US,"Sassy and saucy, with raisin, blueberry, pepper and earth aromas. Kent Rosenblum has crafted a wine that, within its class, is well above average, and we challenge you to find Zin this authentic for this price. What it lacks in nuance is made up for in girth and guts. It's chewy and rich, and it becomes more complex with each minute spent in the glass. Nothing weedy or green here, and the mouthfeel rocks.",Cuvee XXV,87,11.0,California,California,California Other,,,,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
145254,US,"Lots to like in this ultra- dry wine, with its soothingly rich tannins and flavors of wild berries, peppery spices and herbs, and earthy tobacco.

145255,US,"This very ripe, slightly stewed wine runs right at you with full-out fruit flavors, soft and open.

145256,Italy,"From the region of Monferrato, this joyous wine just oozes youth, from its vivid purple hue to its fruity-perfumey aromas and bright flavors of cherries and plums. Sure, it's a little on the simple side, but it's fun to drink and would make a great pizza wine.",,87,9.0,Piedmont,Piedmont,,,,,Barbera,Castelvero
145257,France,"When my wife, normally no great fan of rosé, says, “I really like this wine,” that's an endorsement you can take to the bank. Aromas of wild berries and melon are reserved, the punch solid, and the color a lovely light salmon. This Provençal wine is good year in and year out, so there's no reason not to expect the same from the upcoming 2004. A great summertime refresher that goes down fast and easy. Excellent with salads topped with vinaigrettes.",Rouviere,87,10.0,Provence,Coteaux Varois,,,,,Rosé,Château Routas

145259,US,"A nicely balanced wine that might compare to a particularly ripe spätlese, with just a hint of honeyed botrytis. A balanced palate mixing citrus blossom, apples and lightly roasted almonds.",Late Harvest,87,9.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,,,,Riesling,Covey Run
145260,Italy,"Not the best vintage  for Sassicaia enthusiasts or collectors, but certainly noteworthy thanks to defined herbal aromas such as rosemary and sage backed by black plum, black berry, tobacco, cigar box and leather. The mouthfeel is velvety and supple with unmistakable elegance delivered over a long, menthol-like finish.",Sassicaia,90,180.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tenuta San Guido
145261,Spain,"A single-estate Albariño with clean minerality accenting flowery, grassy aromas. In the mouth, it'sforward and finely chiseled, with pure apple, papaya and saline flavors. Not run of the mill, and for that we like it a lot.",Torre La Moreira,90,19.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,,,,Albariño,Marqués de Vizhoja
145262,Italy,"A slight opening on the nose houses flowery red fruit; it's decidedly not a dark, heavy wine. But it does show some oak. The palate is hard-driving, with firm tannins supporting zesty, almost racy fruit. Nothing manipulated here; just ripe, ready rosso.",Galatrona,90,84.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,,Red Blend,Petrolo
145263,Italy,"Dark and tight, with toasted, masculine aromas that hint at barrique aging. The palate is serious and firm as it houses dark berry and plum flavors along with chocolate and smoke. A forward wine that should please most fans of Tuscan Sangiovese.",Genius Loci,90,26.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,,Sangiovese,Burchino
145264,Italy,"This wine is deeply toasted, boasting almost campfire-like notes lavished over aromas of prune, blackberry, tobacco, leather and a hint of cherry liqueur.

145265,Spain,"Violets, boysenberry and coffee make for an open, plump bouquet that functions as a red carpet for anyone willing to take the plunge.

145266,US,"Huge wine, young and tannic, almost bitter now and not offering much relief. But of course you don't buy Beringer PR tonight. There is indeed enormous Cabernet flavor deep down inside, offering oodles of blackberries and cherries and charry new oak, but there's also a warning note of prune. Best after 2008.",Private Reserve,90,116.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
145267,US,"Here's a nice glass of Cab, rich and dry and ripe.

145268,US,"Opens with a lovely perfume, that sharp, recognizable whiff of ripe Cabernet fruit and toasty new oak. Cherries, cassis, wintergreen, spice and anise in the mouth.

145269,US,"From organically grown (and certified) grapes, this tart, spicy, silky Pinot shows a lot of class and style.

145272,Italy,"Tenuta Sette Ponti's internationally styled blend is heavy and dense, a mirror image of the hot '03 vintage. Thus it pours on the blackberry, plum and fudge flavors with gusto.

Poetico is potent and fairly pure; and it contains 10% Cabernet and 5% Syrah in addition to 85% Malbec. The palate delivers hearty blackberry, plum and vanilla flavors, while the finish is sturdy as a statue, with length and firm tannins.",Poetico,89,21.0,Mendoza Province,Vista Flores,,,,,Malbec,Mauricio Lorca
145349,France,"From one of the family's own estates, this is a fine effort. Rich flavors of pie cherries and a bit of dried spice glide easily across the palate, cushioned by soft, plush tannins.

145350,Chile,"Spicy, dry, red-fruit aromas set you up for a palate that's offering only medium ripeness and not a ton of forward fruit. This is soft-styled with some buttery oak and limited follow through on the finish. Doesn't live up to its gran reserva billing but isn't offensive, either.",Gran Reserva,85,16.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Morandé

In the mouth, it delivers solid structure and medium persistent. Try with simple pasta dishes or pizza. Screwcap.",Conti Contini,85,,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,,Sangiovese,Capezzana
145355,US,"In keeping with past vintages, this new release is finished at just under 3% residual sugar. Simple fruit flavors suggest grapefruit and fresh cut slices of orange. The wine seems to lose its focus in the mouth, and does not add any layers or complexity once you've latched on to that first taste. It's competent but not up to the gorgeous scents and flavors of the past four or five vintages.",,85,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Gewürztraminer,Columbia Winery
145356,Chile,"A direct reflection of Chile's cool and wet '02 vintage. This has an underdeveloped side to it; it seems short, tight and striving for a level of ripeness and balance it's not about to achieve. That it comes from good enough vines and good enough people assures that it's not a bad wine. But the 2003 is quite a bit better.",Le Dix de Los Vascos,85,44.0,Colchagua Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)
145357,US,"This feels like a cool-climate Sauvignon, with light melon and citrus flavors, alcohol at just 12%, and a bone dry finish. This blend of Cabernet and Syrah shows pretty fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry candy, with a bit of cinnamon spice. Light and lively, it's a style more reminiscent of the sort of wine you might encounter in a carafe in a seaside town in the south of France.",La Ronde Red Wine,85,24.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,,,,Red Blend,Eleven
145358,Chile,"A heavy whiff of balsam wood and dried leaves accents the brambly berry aromas that make up the bouquet.

Has power but runs a bit herbal and rough.",Max Reserva,85,21.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,,,,Merlot,Errazuriz
145359,US,"The Rainy Day Red is mostly Milbrandt vineyard Syrah. It's young and grapy, lively and fun, much like a Beaujolais.

145360,US,"Already looking like it's well on its way to maturity, this affordable blend opens with pretty aromas of black olive, baked plum, white chocolate and black cherry.

145364,Chile,"Pungent and citric, which tells you right away that it's Casablanca. Very tropical and green on the palate, with quite a bit in common with Sauvignon Blanc.

145367,US,"Although this is 100% Merlot it is labeled simply Red Wine, as previously the blend has been half Cabernet. With the vines recovering from a bad freeze, Pepper Bridge fruit presented some challenges in 2005. This wine still seems disjointed, with too many green and stemmy flavors wrapped into light streaks of spice and pepper. The strawberry-flavored fruit seems barely ripe.

145370,Chile,"Experimentation and derivations on existing lines are what Concha y Toro is all about these days.

Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Casillero del Diablo Reserva Privada,85,16.0,Central Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Concha y Toro
145371,New Zealand,"Pungent and sweaty, with a slight oniony cast to the aromas. White nectarine flavors partially balance out the pungency, but this is a strident, powerful wine that ultimately could use a great sense of harmony. It makes a statement, so fans of the style should take notice.",Premium Selection,85,16.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Selaks
145372,US,"Barrel-fermented in 100% new oak, this is very full-bodied, a little too much so, as the citrus, fig and yeast flavors get bogged down with their own weight.

145374,Chile,"For a higher-end wine from San Pedro, we'd like to see a little more in the way of focus and less blast-furnace oak. The wine initially smells like a hickory factory, and even when that woodiness calms down there are rough-hewn tannins and an herbal core identity. On the plus side, it does get better and better with airing.",1865 Reserva,85,20.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,San Pedro

145376,US,"Desert Wind wines as a rule fall on the thin and watery side, but here the exceptional vintage has provided a welcome bit of concentration. Banana and tropical fruit are not especially rich but are reasonably persistent. Some time in new oak would have added depth to the finish, but then it wouldn't be bare naked.",Desert Wind Vineyard Bare Naked,84,15.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,,,,Chardonnay,Desert Wind
145377,South Africa,"A flinty, crisp and restrained minerality leads, clearly reflecting the soil from which it is produced.

With seafood or a lively vinaigrette salad, the wine shows promise.",,84,10.0,Lutzville Valley,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Diamond River
145378,Chile,"Sweet on the nose, with welcoming almond, pear and citrus blossom notes. The palate is also on the sweet side, with slightly sugary pear and cantaloupe flavors.

145379,US,"The Genesis Cab has far more stuffing than its companion Merlot, with chewy tannins and alcohol pushing 15%. Still, it seems to lack depth, or at least the sort of appealing fruit flavors that can compensate for a lack of density. It's chewy and red, with a chalky finish that needs some sort of rich food to work through.",Genesis,84,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hogue
145380,US,"Another huge '99. It is very dark and lavishly oaked, aged in 100% new French barrels. The immediate aroma is of vanilla and toast, while the palate experience is of oak and dry tannins that numb the palate through the finish. There is a core of blackberry fruit that is solid and dense, the result of very low yields. This pricy wine is not drinkable now, unless you're not fussy. If you buy it, plan on aging for at least five years.",Reserve,91,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Harrison
145381,US,"This old Sonoma grapegrowing family's hommage to their forebears is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. It is an excellent wine, succulently filled with juicy flavors of cherries and blackcurrants, with sexy tannins that are muscular, but negotiable. It will probably soften in a few years.",Omaggio,91,45.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Red Blend,Seghesio
145382,US,"One of seven limited-production, single-vineyard Cabs this vintage by Beringer, a dense, concentrated mountain wine of considerable strength.

145383,Italy,"This is 100% Sangiovese made outside the Chianti DOC, but it drinks like a Brunello. There are fine leather, dried fruit and earth aromas that create a tight bouquet.

Sturdy stuff with a subdued personality in a world of wines gone wild.",Fabula,91,16.0,Tuscany,Tuscany,,,,,Sangiovese,Maretima
145384,US,"Another of the new crop of Cabs, and a very good wine. Meets Napa standards of rich, ripe blackberry and currant fruit and perfectly soft tannins, and is well oaked.

145390,Germany,"Smoky and intense, with peach, melon and floral aromas that burst from the glass.

145392,US,"This richly flavorful wine is smoky and lush, with hints of cassis and black cherry and dusty spices.

145394,US,"Always an interesting Bordeaux blend to taste, this mixture of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon, Malvasia Bianca and Orange Muscat is alive with citrus, orange blossom, mineral and dried herb aromas and flavors.

145395,US,"Showcases the shortcomings of the vintage as well as the strengths of its terroir and winemaking.

A charming wine meant for early drinking.",Rubicon,90,100.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,,,,Red Blend,Niebaum-Coppola
145396,US,"Richer and more complete than the '98 La Joie, with which it was simultaneously released. This wine shows its mountain origins in its tough young tannins and hard edges, but there is enough cherry and blackberry fruit for the long haul.

145398,US,"This is an astonishing value, especially from such a prestigious appellation. Has a silky texture and lush but dry flavors of cherries, raspberries, herbs, mushrooms, coffee and clove that unfold across the palate.

145399,US,"Luscious, long, full-bodied and rich, a wonderful wine that showcases its appellation. Has well-ripened flavors of blackcurrants and cassis that drink long and deep, although there's some hollowness, which costs it a few points.

145401,Spain,"A modern-style offering from the up-and-coming region of Yecla, near Alicante. The grape used is Monastrell, a k a Mourvèdre. It's bold and packed with blackberry, pepper and other spices. It's the perfect wine to enjoy with barbecue, stews and roasts.

Bright acidity keeps the wine from feeling heavy;  the spicy cherry-toasty oak finish is dry, even and long.

145509,Italy,"Rosso di Montepulciano is the Junior Varsity version of Brunello di Montalcino and is often a very good value for current consumption. Cherry and plum aromas and flavors abound, supported nicely by a solid but not hard acid and tannic structure.

145510,Italy,"The black cherry fruit is accented by soy, menthol and olive notes on the nose in this polished but reserved wine.

145511,US,"Vanilla, cocoa and tobacco highlight the berry fruit of this compact red. The mouthfeel is rich and not overly soft, the fruit ripe, but without the depth of the estate bottling. The finish is slightly hot, but marked by good length and tobacco and toast notes.",,87,24.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Merlot,Kirkland Ranch
145512,Australia,"A first-rate Merlot, this big-boned wine has juicy, rich flavors that explode out of the glass and last right through the rich, long finish.

Best Buy.",Diamond Label,87,11.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Merlot,Rosemount
145513,Australia,"A gentle fruitiness marks this approachable, drink-me-now wine.

145514,Australia,"Smells young and elusive, with earthy, green aromas masking riper notes of blackberries and cassis. There's little oak evident here. The wine tastes riper than you'd expect, with sweet blackberry fruit, but high acidity keeps it on the austere side. A highly structured wine that is fine on its own and even better with the right foods.",,87,21.0,Victoria,Mornington Peninsula,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Willow Creek
145515,Italy,"This wine has a fragrant nose of violets, chocolate and tobacco. It's medium-bodied and succulent with soft cherry, tobacco and mineral flavors.

145517,Italy,"So pale that it's almost colorless, the Blangé—made from Arneis grapes in Piedmont—has the oak-meets-citrus nose you'd expect of a Chardonnay. The lemon, grapefruit and pear flavors, coupled with a superspritzy, Asti-like mouthfeel, make this a good Sunday brunch eye-opener. Its slightly high acidity could cut through any French toast or waffle that you throw its way. Finishes medium-long, with herbal notes.",Blangé,87,30.0,Piedmont,Piedmont,,,,,Arneis,Ceretto
145518,Australia,"This very pale, crisply flavorful white has great backbone and surprising presence. It cuts a lean profile with pear and herb aromas and flavors predominating, a touch of vanilla and mild spice for added interest.

145520,Australia,"Forward fruit and a soft mouthfeel characterize this Merlot from a region famous for Cabernet Sauvignon.

145526,Italy,"No oak is used on this full- fruited red. Just a hint of chocolate-cocoa is evident, but what's on display are rich, dry cherry flavors and a ripe, supple mouthfeel.

145527,Italy,"This 75% Sangiovese-25% Cabernet Sauvignon wine's tangy dried cherry fruit shows herb, tobacco and leather accents.

145528,Australia,"Ah, the great outdoors. On the nose, raspberry, blackberry and plum meet tobacco and hickory, campfire-like aromas.

145531,Australia,"This wine is 70% Shiraz, with Cabernets Franc and Sauvignon filling out the rest of the blend. The JSM isn't quite as good this vintage as it has been in the past, owing largely to its stewy fruit flavors. But it does have its high points.

145536,Australia,"Dusty black cherry aromas preface a similar profile on the palate: Dark plums, black cherry, wheat bread, and an earthy/leafy hint.

145542,US,"Lake County has made a play to become the inexpensive Sauvignon Blanc capital of California, and this wine shows why. Stephen Vincent is a Sonoma négociant who finds wines that have already been made and then buys them to bottle under his brand.

145549,France,"Throwing a healthy sediment already, this blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre could actually use another six months or so to drop additional tannin. It's an unusually forceful vintage for this wine, which is usually friendly and forward.

The Rockford wines cost about $40. The Chris Ringland wines? $400, if you're lucky. In any case, this Grenache is a bargain.

145558,Italy,"Not sure what's notorious about this Syrah, which tastes more like a good but generic red wine than anything identifiable as Syrah. That said, the nose is jammy, with hints of bacon, soy and teriyaki. Toasted nuances and buttery notes add a barrel influence to the palate.

145560,Germany,"Starts off really promising, with scents of honey, spiced pears, slaty-minerally  notes and a touch of diesel. Flavors follow suit, cleaned up on the finish by mild citrusy notes. The only problem area for this wine is its mouthfeel, which lacks the lightness and grace to score higher, instead coming across as slightly round and bulky.",Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese,89,40.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,,,,Riesling,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler
145561,Italy,"Dark and fruity on the nose, with a touch of gritty leather. Brighter on the palate, where cherry and raspberry hold court and oak plays in the background.

145562,Italy,"Here's a portly offering, and then some. Talk about a dark, soft, meaty wine. This one is so rich, ripe and loaded with black plums and berries that it's almost sleepy.

145563,Spain,"More available than most Valdeorras wines—and very good in 2005—Godeval offers a no-nonsense version of the Godello grape.

145564,Italy,"Big, black and textured, but even with all of its guts, color and polish, it isn't very unique, and that's despite the 60% Colorino and 40% Merlot it's made of. Blackberry and plum dominate the muscular palate, while the roasted finish is nice but simple. Very good on its best day.",Romitorio di Santedame,89,70.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,,Red Blend,Ruffino
145565,US,"Very soft and approachable, but perhaps a bit too soft—it's almost pillowy, with a mouthfeel like marshmallow. Good black cherry fruit dominates the core.

145568,South Africa,"Rustenberg's second label, Brampton, enclosed in screwcap, shines because of its focus on fruit. This Shiraz glows with aromas of cola, sour cherry, lemon and spice.

145572,South Africa,"A touch buttery on the nose at first, this wine quickly shows mango, vanilla and toast aromas.

145574,US,"Many of the same vineyard sources that supply the winery's reserve are found here as well; this feels like a lighter, less concentrated version of that more expensive bottling. But there is more: nuances of cola, root beer, green tea, grilled meat and molasses that seem to be missing from the bigger wine.

145575,South Africa,"Rich and dark, with full, smooth tannins, this big wine explodes with flavors of tar, cassis, plum and integrated oak.

145578,South Africa,"Heavily oaked, with toasty vanilla aromas, this full wine still manages a high acidic core along with a round exterior.

145580,Italy,"Tasted for the first time in nearly three years, this Sangiovese-dominated super Tuscan seems to have improved, as now it shows a seductive, dry earthiness along with cinnamon and tree bark.

145589,Spain,"La Val is an O Rosal winery but its wines are 100% Albariño. This estate-grown white offers a yellowish tint with pretty aromas of buttercup and apple blossoms. It's fairly light-bodied and exhilarating, with pure flavors of apples, honeydew and citrus. Shows good acidity.",Finca de Arantei,89,20.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,,,,Albariño,La Val
145590,US,"From Shenandoah Valley and Fiddletown grapes, Terre Rouge has crafted a rich, exotic Viognier.

145592,US,"This racy Cabernet is full of tart red fruits; its flavors are forward and lightly spicy. The wine seems to have been acidified, perhaps to provide some lift. It is a nicely focused effort; I like the way it gathers itself and holds that focus through a smooth, seamless, long finish.",Reserve,90,27.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goose Ridge
145593,US,"Dark, almost black cherry colored, this is an authoritative wine with concentrated layers of red and black fruits. It's thick through the midpalate, then swings into an interesting, minty, lifted, citrusy finish. Spicy and tart, with real meat on its bones.",Vintners Old Vine Estate,90,50.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Merlot,Kestrel
145594,Australia,"Tight and taut from the get-go, time in the glass not resolving the thick woody tannins that envelop the plum and blackberry fruit that lies beneath. Anise, curry spice and bread flour does come to the fore, though. Add a backbone of lively acidity to this picture and the result is a wine that'll shine much more in 2009 than it does now. 59% Cabernet, 19% Merlot, 15% Cab Franc, 7% Malbec. Imported by Boutique International.",Cluny,90,25.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Zema Estate

145596,Australia,"Right out of the gate, there's a pungent aroma of cat pee, plus nuts and floral notes.

Imported by The Colonial Wine Company Pty Ltd.",Évangéliste Reserve,90,30.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,,,,Chardonnay,The Colonial Estate
145597,Australia,"A puzzle. An excellent wine with an excellent reputation from an excellent vintage, but one that we felt didn't quite live up to some of its past incarnations. Has aromas of plum, raspberry, vanilla and oak, with many of the same notes reprising on the palate. As good as it is, there's something missing this year. Tasted twice; note reflects the higher score. Imported by Pacific Wine Partners.",E&E; Black Pepper,90,85.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,,,,Shiraz,Barossa Valley Estate
145598,Argentina,"Ripe and cushy, with deeply defined fruit aromas that carry enough soft touches to make you want to dig in.

145601,Argentina,"Gets going with aromas of molasses, black olive and pencil lead, which accent the rich black fruit that's prominently on display.

145603,US,"Tart and sharp, with a pleasing tang and snap. The complex, clean and crisp flavors layer fig, citrus rind and clove with high notes of candied orange and citrus blossom.

145605,US,"Gallo's Rancho Zabaco has done a fine job with single-vineyard Zins.

145606,US,"Somewhat in the same tight, austere, guarded mode as the winery's Bordeaux blend, this cabernet franc breathes slowly into elegant complexity. Spicy, compact blue and red fruits are lightly accented with sweet spice.",,90,20.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Franc,Red Sky
145607,US,"Off-dry, with bright acids, this viscous and gloriously peachy Chenin reminds me of why I love this sadly neglected grape. Bursting with stone fruits, lively  crisp acids, and softened by the residual fruit sugar and kissed with a streak of honey, it captures so much ripe, autumnal flavor in a single bottle.",,90,10.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Chenin Blanc,Townshend
145608,US,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is a more subtle, and more interesting wine than the winery's Cab Franc. Here the ripeness seems more stable and balanced, with just the right hints of leaf and bark, and a subtle suggestion of chocolate. The finish is smooth and textural, and a bit of coffee kicks in right at the end; very nice.",,90,45.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sheridan Vineyard
145609,Australia,"Winemaker Noel Heidenreich's Shiraz is compelling, not overwhelming, with some vanilla flavors framing juicy red plum and raspberry fruit. It's pleasing and textured, and gives the same impression on the nose: spice, curry, moist clay, red fruit. Very appealing overall, tiptoeing out on the finish with soft tannins. Imported by The Australian Wine Connection.",,90,34.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,,,,Shiraz,Old School
145610,Australia,"A crisp, cool style of Shiraz—if you think “eucalyptus” equals “medicinal,” this probably isn't your cup of tea. But there's a lot to like about this wine's gumtree, black pepper and blackberry aromas, and the way that its earth-clay feel steals the show on the palate. Has blueberries and blackberries at its core, and a dusting of cinnamon arund the edges. Crisp and lasting on the finish. Imported by Pan Pacific Wines.",Grand Reserve,90,55.0,South Australia,Wrattonbully,,,,,Shiraz,Pepper Tree
145611,US,"This is a very good wine, and this everyday price makes it a real bargain.

145612,Argentina,"A bit of marmalade and violets accent the bold, dark nose. Not at all subtle, with syrupy berry flavors offset by a whack of bitter chocolate.

145614,US,"Red and black fruit flavors are complemented with clove, cinnamon and roasted barrel scents. The wine hits a bit of a wall in the midpalate, but that may just mean it requires a little extra time (or breathing). It's a good, flavorful effort, and the barrels add nice flavors of bacon and smoke.",,89,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Merlot,Goose Ridge
145615,Australia,"This Sauvignon starts off with a very pretty lemon meringue aroma, which translates on the palate as a dusty-citrus core. There's a helping of fresh green herbs and peas just at palate entry, with white peach and green apple flavors on the midpalate. Round and a shade less zesty than it has been in previous vintages, but still one of the prettier Hills SBs available in the U.S.",,89,17.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Groom
145616,Australia,"This couldn't be from anywhere but Coonawarra: its clay-earth texture is its hallmark. Flavors of plum, bramble, mint and spice persist through the finish.

Smoke and earth on the nose. Drink now–2010.",Five Sisters,89,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
145620,US,"This is a wonderful Merlot, dark and plummy. The nose introduces a round, warm entrance, with hints of leather, wood, herb and spice.

Michelle
145622,US,"Mainly Cab Sauvignon, unusually blended with some Argentine Malbec, this is a dark, full-bodied, dry wine, rich and long in fruit.

145623,Spain,"Spicy and savory smelling, with interesting aromas that encompass maple, chili powder, smoked meat and mildly baked berries.

But overall this wine is exceedingly pleasant, well made and pretty much ready to drink now.",Gran Abadia Mediterrània,89,65.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,,,,Red Blend,Costers del Priorat
145624,Argentina,"In the past this was a Bordeaux blend but now it's all or almost all Malbec. And because it hails from cooler Tupungato it features floral aromas more than heavy berry scents, and in the mouth it's all about red fruit as opposed to beefy black fruit. If it's a bit short on the finish, chalk that up to its racier, more streamlined frame.",Synthesis,89,25.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,,,,Malbec,Finca Sophenia
145625,Australia,"Perennially one of Western Australia's best Rieslings, this is a medium-bodied effort that's deceptively light on its feet for having 13.5% alcohol.

145627,US,"This has acids and tannins and plenty of structure. The winemaker is aiming at an ageworthy, more classic wine. It needs time, or at the very least, serious decanting. But the stuffing is there. Hold until 2010.",,89,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Karl Lawrence

145629,US,"Dense, dry and young, this is a Syrah for the cellar. With 10% Petite Sirah, it has some fierce tannins, and is a little soft, but possesses the inherent balance to age.

145630,Austria,"The long slope of the Wagram, a relic of the ice age, gives its name to the Terrassen (Terraces) vineyard.

145631,Italy,"Here is a firm, extracted and well-built Aglianico (80%) and Piedirosso blend that benefits from decanting a few hours before being served. Aromas of ruby pomegranate, black cherry and blueberry are backed by territory-driven notes of ash and granite slate.

145633,Austria,"This is from the premium range produced by the Winzer Krems cooperative. It is a freshly fruity, bramble-flavored wine, lifted with acidity, light flavors of wood and a good, fresh, juicy, spicy aftertaste.",Kellermeister Privat Goldberg,89,,Kremstal,,,,,,Grüner Veltliner,Winzer Krems
145634,US,"Soft, herbal and showing a streak of sweet baking spice, this unusual red wine immediately sets itself apart from more ordinary Bordeaux blends. Slightly more than half Cabernet, a third Cab Franc and 10% Merlot, this definitely has the pedigreed vineyard fruit. The almost supernal softness of the wine suggests some sort of micro-oxidation, yet it remains sappy and tart. Flavors continue through a myriad of baking spices into a rich and extended finish. The only detriments: the acids are a bit chalky, and the finish lacks finesse. But it's a lovely bottle simply to drink.",Laurella,89,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Saviah
145635,Austria,"From densely planted vines, this is a ripe, very fruity wine, with low acidity, emphasizing the cream and pepper character of the grape. It is not the style of Grüner that can be drunk too young—give it another year to be at its optimum.",8000,89,33.0,Niederösterreich,,,,,,Grüner Veltliner,Setzer
145636,US,"High in acidity and bone dry, this light-colored Pinot seems a bit one-dimensional right now, but I think it was released too early. It should gain momentum by the end of 2007, when the cherry, rhubarb and cola flavors become more integrated with the tannins and oak. If you have to drink it now, decant for several hours.",Sapphire Hill Vineyard,89,42.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,,Pinot Noir,Siduri
145637,US,"This is the fourth vintage for this rare Washington version of Petite Sirah, and the best yet.

145638,Spain,"If you don't mind some heavy barrel char, then you'll probably like this rough rider. It has espresso and asphalt on the nose, and then you get leathery plum and berry fruit on the palate. A good wine, with a long finish, lots of oak and overall balance. In a nutshell, there's plenty going on.",Valdunes,89,20.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,,,,Tempranillo,Tierra Adentro
145639,Argentina,"Pure, jammy and heady: voilà, it's modern Malbec. The palate here is inviting, with decadent plum and blackberry flavors working in tandem.

145640,France,"Muscular, powering its way with richness and structured tannins. The white pear and almond flavors seem to sit on top of this dense wine, which will need to age.

145642,US,"This is very fresh and crisp, mingling light citrus and green apple fruit with interesting herbal enticements of white pepper and tarragon. Just a touch (6%) of Viognier in the blend adds to the citrus and floral highlights.

145643,Spain,"Not often do you come across an aged Valdepeñas red, especially one with style, structure and character.

145644,US,"This shows the sappy, sweet, ripe character of the grape; fresh and forward and bursting with flavors of just-picked berries.

145645,Spain,"Scala Dei seems to have managed 2003's tough conditions, and this is endowed with sweet Garnacha-driven aromas that touch up against raisiny but don't cross the line.

145646,US,"Here's a well-made wine that shows that this important producer can rise to the challenge when it retains its focus on varietal character. This authoritative, smoky wine smells like Syrah and it follows through with firm, supple, rich flavors. The floral and citrus notes, the herbal/olive underpinnings, the ripe—not roasted—fruit all hit the mark.",Proprietor's Reserve,89,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Syrah,Maryhill
145647,US,"More tannic and substantial than the Merlot, this shows cool-climate flavors that bring out citrus, pepper and some lightly green tannins.

145648,US,"A very limited production wine from a new Walla Walla vineyard, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak and softened up with partial malo. It leans a bit more toward the citrus/pineapple flavor side than does the winery's regular Chardonnay bottling. This is a bit crisper, with subtle grassy highlights adding some lift and interest.",Birch Creek Vineyard,88,28.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Chardonnay,Dusted Valley
145649,US,"A blast of SO2 quickly blows off after pulling the cork, revealing a lovely mix of fruit and a more authentic, varietal herbaceous character.

Michelle
145650,US,"Starts out very clean, with focused, sharp aromas of lemon, lime, and grapefruit, with some floral, honeyed notes.

145653,US,"A grassy, herbaceous wine, almost aggressively so. Definitely veers toward those grapefruit, cat-pee aromas that characterize less-than-ripe grapes.

Those who like this style will find it clean and refreshing.",,84,12.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Fumé Blanc,Dry Creek Vineyard

But it drinks thin, although not rough, and there's a green chlorophyll note that no amount of aging will get rid of.",,82,18.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,,,,Merlot,Buttonwood Farm
145669,US,"A simple, everyday red that won't break the bank. The grapes tend to get a little baked this far inland, especially Merlot, which really needs just the right conditions to maintain delicacy and balance. As a result the dominant notes are earthy, with a slightly baked or raisiny quality. The tannins, needless to say, are soft, and the acidity is low.",,82,9.0,California,Dunnigan Hills,Central Valley,,,,Merlot,R.H. Phillips
145670,US,"The aromas are watery and very faint, suggestive of kiwi, lime and vanilla. Flavors are similarly very light. What the palate gives is alcohol, acidity and sugar, with just the barest trace of citrus.",,81,9.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Chenin Blanc,Hoodsport
145671,US,"If Monterey has a problem with Cabernet Sauvignon, the challenges for Merlot are even more formidable, as this tough, thin, earthy wine shows. These grapes just didn't get ripe enough. so the dominant notes are herbaceous and tannic. It also finishes watery.",Coastal Selection,81,13.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,,,,Merlot,Mirassou
145672,US,"Has indistinct watery aromas of lemons and buttercups. Fresh and clean, but the flavors are weak and washed out. There's adequate acidity and alcohol, but your palate really has to work to ferret out the lemony flavors.",,81,9.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Sémillon,Hoodsport
145673,US,"Complex aromas of cassis, dough, espresso, bacon, and cola create instant interest. It seduces with its rich dark fruit and earth flavors, and a concentrated, suave mouthfeel. Big flavors and tannins don't quit on the long, even finish. Profoundly enjoyable, seamless and shows impeccable balance. Keep for five to seven years; it will last a long time.",Reserve,96,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lewis
145674,US,"The lovely bouquet of blackberry jam, oak with mint, cedar, and black olives draws you in. Broad and rich on the palate, with ample but fine tannins. Great depth of dark-berry fruit, with coffee and cedar shadings. The explosive finish just keeps going as intriguing sweet-tart fruit and bitter chocolate notes please all the way out. Best to hold six to nine years.",,95,125.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cardinale
145675,US,"Enormous aromatics of vanilla and chocolate, dark berries and spice cake. Yet it holds on to the subtle notes as well. An open palate with sweet-tart fruit and vanilla notes. The rich, round feel, the depth of fruit, and the velvety tannins nearly veil the solid structure. Finishes dry and long, with coffee and chocolate flavors. A newcomer with budding cult credentials. Hold three to five years if you can keep your hands off it.",,95,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jones Family
145676,US,"Opens with aromas of black cherry and pencil lead, fruitcake and cookie dough; now it's all one big melange wrapped a bit tight. The balance and immense depth of fruit shine, even in this unevolved state. Standard dark-plum and chocolate notes are rendered with uncommon subtlety here. The finish goes on and on. Needs four to six years, but will last and last.",Insignia,95,120.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Joseph Phelps
145677,US,"Very solid and deep, with a bouquet of delicious black-currant and dark-cherry fruit and toasty, buttery oak. Very comfortable mouthfeel.

Tight now; hold for three to six years.",,95,50.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pine Ridge
145678,US,"Great depth and purity of fruit. It shines with lovely violet and lavender accents. Very dark cassis, black plum, coffee and toasty oak flavors, with handsome herb and spice accents. The mouthfeel is excellent—big, but almost perfectly balanced between lush richness and solid tannic structure. A keeper needing four to six years.",T Bar T,94,35.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Iron Horse
145679,US,"Toasty oak is wrapped around some complex elements: blackberry, violets, tar, cedar, coffee and game.

Great potential; hold two to five years at least.",Reserve,94,42.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sequoia Grove
145680,Italy,"Aromas of cassis, cola and a hint of lemon make for an attractive bouquet. The mouth is a bit tangy due to electric red fruit bolstered by powerful acids.

145682,Germany,"Johannes Leitz is rightfully proud of his 2002s. This is his entry-level wine, and it's gorgeous, with a touch of sweetness and slightly rounder acidity than last year's version (which, incidentally, is still going strong). It boasts copious apple, red berry and citrus flavors and a forceful, lingering finish. Sinfully easy to drink.",Rudesheimer Drachenstein Riesling QbA,90,12.0,Rheingau,,,,,,Riesling,Josef Leitz
145683,US,"Easily deserves its high score due to the ripe cassis flavors and near-perfect tannins. Caresses and seduces the palate with the soft velvety intensity of a fine liqueur. Yet some tough tannins and firm acidity make for a scour on the palate. May or may not age; hard to tell. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot.",Estate,90,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Blend,Judd's Hill
145684,US,"A nice, easy-drinking Cabernet that has some real complexity. Opens with cassis, smoke and herb aromas that turn rich and fruity in the mouth.

145685,Portugal,"A reasonably good buy in vintage Port, Silval is something of a second label for Quinta do Noval. It's less concentrated and suppler in the mouth than its sister wine, but still boasts compelling floral aromas allied to prune, berry and chocolate flavors. Worth trying a bottle before 2010.",Silval Vintage,90,37.0,Port,,,,,,Port,Quinta do Noval
145686,US,"Rich and thoroughly enjoyable, brimming with blackcurrant and cassis flavors and a balanced overlay of smoky, spicy oak.

145687,Portugal,"Intentionally made in a friendly, fruit-forward style, Vau doesn't disappoint in 2000. It delivers what we've come to expect from this relatively recent creation, lush blackberry and plum flavors backed by clove and spice. If you like your Ports young and fruity, try this one soon; its longevity is untested.",Vau Vintage,90,45.0,Port,,,,,,Port,Sandeman
145688,US,"Exceedingly dark, and starts off closed and mute, a difficult wine to evaluate in its youth. If you open it now, give it plenty of airing. Currently gives of aromas of dill, cured olives and earth, although there is a tremendous core of sweet blackberry buried under the tannins, which are soft and fine.",Block 8,90,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hendry
145689,US,"Another polished, succulent release from a vineyard that's not supposed to be warm enough to ripen Cabernet. Of course, the vintage was very good, and this effort shows upfront blackcurrant and leather flavors, with a long, fruity finish. It's generously oaked, and really excellent.",Rochioli Vineyard,90,42.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Longboard
145690,US,"Tempting to think you could blind-taste this and identify it as upscale Napa Cabernet. True, the vintage has limited the richness, but it's still a polished wine, with delicious cassis, olive and herb flavors and sumptuous, velvety tannins. Turns dry and oaky on the finish, and will hold for several years in your cellar.",Estate Select,90,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Reynolds Family Winery
145691,Portugal,"A selection of lots not deemed worthy of inclusion in this estate's flagship red, Meandro is nevertheless a fine wine and an even better value. Smoke and herbs add complexity to the blueberries and blackberries found on the nose, while the flavors combine lush fruit with intense notes of spice and anise. Drink now–2008.",Meandro,90,19.0,Douro,,,,,,Red Blend,Quinta do Vale Meão
145692,Italy,"Wonderful smelling, with leather, clove and powerful black fruit. How nice to see a '99 rosso doing so well now.

Finishes tight and firm, meaning it still has some time to go.",,90,14.0,Tuscany,Rosso di Montepulciano,,,,,Prugnolo Gentile,Fattoria Del Cerro
145693,US,"Made in a classic Napa style, with pronounced aromas of cassis and blackcurrant and a considerably layering of well-charred, toasty oak. Doesn't disappoint on the entry, and then it spreads currant and herb flavors all over the palate, wrapped in rich, fine, ripe tannins. Very good, but lacks that extra bit of intensity.",,90,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barlow
145694,Portugal,"Barros's tawnies are worth seeking out. This young example shows the house's signature smoky, nutty aromas but adds more fruity scents of raisins and prunes. Supple in the mouth, with a long, toffee-filled finish.",10 Years Old,90,25.0,Port,,,,,,Port,Barros
145695,Italy,"Lush and deep to the nose, with clove, chocolate and pure potting soil. Elaborate in the mouth, with plum and coffee flavors. It's a touch hard at the end, but also intense.

145696,Italy,"Smoky and tight, with a hint of lemony oak on the nose. The palate bursts with ripe cassis, cherry and tannin, while later on you get a smack of cough drop as the red fruit unfolds.

145697,Australia,"Well balanced and medium bodied, this isn't a biting-acids, oyster-ready sort of Riesling. Instead, it's rather feminine, with pretty sunflower, honey and peach fuzz flavors swathed in chalk. The nose has nice, waxy yellow melon and citrus notes. Delicate, easy to find, and a bargain, as are most all of Wynns' “Coonawarra”-labeled bottlings, which are all priced in the low-to-mid teens.",,90,12.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,,,,Riesling,Wynns Coonawarra Estate
145698,Italy,"Well oaked and woodsy, with some earthy nuances as well as scents of campfire and rubber. This is a youngster with aggressive tannins and sharp edges.

145701,Italy,"Big and bold, with overt barrique qualities manifested on the nose and palate. Aromas of ink, leather, maple and leather draw you in, and once in you'll find cassis, prune, blackberry and bitter chocolate. Heavy tannins create a starchy mouthfeel that begs for food.",,90,30.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,,,,Sangiovese,Brancaia
145702,Portugal,"Toast and vanilla notes from oak barrels are layered over aromas of cured meat and blackberries. On the palate, it's lush but not overly weighty or rich, just nicely balanced. There's plenty of spicy oak, especially on the finish, but also the fruit to support it.",Carm Reserva,90,23.0,Douro,,,,,,Touriga Nacional,Roberedo Madeira
145703,US,"Another fine vintage for this veteran Napa winery. Shows a classic Napa character, with ripe flavors of cassis and blackcurrants and finely-ground, complex but easy tannins.

145704,Portugal,"This young vintage Port is quite big, with plenty of lush fruit and some herb and spice notes.

145705,Italy,"This wine from Melini is maturing nicely and seems to be in perfect drinking form. It's a blend of 70% Cabernet and 30% Sangiovese, and it shows patented dried-fruit, leather and caramel aromas, a peppery, cherry palate, and some light oak on the finish.

145708,US,"Quite a distinguished '99, with its flamboyant aromas of spicy blackcurrants and cassis, with an oaky overlay of smoke and vanilla.

The jolt of dry tannins that makes the palate puckery suggests midterm aging.",Reserve,90,38.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,William Hill Estate
145709,US,"Classic Napa Cab, and very pretty. Opens with pure, strong aromas of blackcurrants and oak, with similar flavors, plus a streak of cherries and chocolate.

145710,New Zealand,"Amply oaked, but it works well in the context of this wine, adding hints of bacon and wood dust to the lovely rose petal and cherry aromas. Medium-bodied, with silky tannins on the finish that add just enough structure for balance.",Reserve,89,,Martinborough,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Vynfields
145711,US,"Lemony and grassy, this very dry, tart wine is refreshing and zesty. Sur lie aging has given it body and structure, while a good proportion of new oak gives complex notes of smoke and vanilla. Totally dry.",Estate,88,25.0,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Chalk Hill
145712,New Zealand,"Starts with a dusty, savory, spicy bouquet, then unfurls ripe black cherry flavors on the palate. Shows some slightly animale and sous-bois notes on the finish.

145713,France,"A 50/50 blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this is a full-bodied wine, with layers of toast and some good maturity.

145721,Australia,"Though the aromas and flavors are really nice, this wine's flat, woody feel keeps it from being as excellent as it could be.

145727,US,"This Zin is very similar to Peachy Canyon's Especial Zin, with aromas suggesting thyme, sage and spicy white pepper, and rich flavors of wild dark berries and chocolate.

145728,US,"This single-vineyard wine showcases the ripeness and smoothness of Amador Zin at its best. It has briary, wild berry flavors, with a roasted coffee and chocolate finish.

145734,New Zealand,"Lush and supple, boasting ample cherry and vanilla aromas and flavors. It's easily approachable, yet still shows decent complexity in a slightly herbal-briary nuance.

145737,US,"This is a big, ripe wine, and fairly tannic too, although the tannins are soft, ripe and sweet.

145752,US,"A very good Zin that's more tannic than Mariah's Mendocino Ridge wines, and a little less concentrated in fruit. Nonetheless, it's dry, big-hearted and warming in berries and spices.",Poor Ranch Vineyard,90,35.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,,,,Zinfandel,Mariah
145753,France,"Named in homage to its founder, Gambert de Loche, this is one of the top wines from the Tain cooperative. It is young in color, with fresh fruit and solid tannins.

145754,France,"This is a blend from three of the top Hermitage vineyards - L'Ermite, le Sabot and Les Bessards. It is powerful and rich, with black fruits, spices and leather aromas.

145755,France,"This is old-style winemaking, but in the best sense. It is big, dominated at this stage by tannins. The fruit is dark, brooding and intense. It has layers of wood (of which 20 percent was new), while the acidity still needs to soften out. This will age, maybe 10-12 years.",,90,88.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,,,,Syrah,Domaine Jamet
145756,France,"Not a blockbuster, but a medium-weight Riesling that should age almost indefinitely on its taut spine of acidity.

145760,US,"This was the first block of pinot noir planted by the Sokol Blossers in the early 1970s, and it benefits from its maturity, its peerless location in the Red Hills of Dundee, and the fact that it is own-rooted and has escaped the ravages of phylloxera.

145771,Australia,"It's the color of fake blood but (I'm guessing) this wine is much more palatable.

145775,Italy,"Already shows a bit of brown to its hue, but that's not terribly unusual for Nebbiolo. Aromas of leather, soy sauce and tar are classic, followed up on the palate by tart cherry flavors that come across as a bit lean.

145777,Italy,"Right now, the slight spritz that gives this wine its zip is just a little too prominent. The pear and peach fruit tinged with bitter almond is fresh enough to stand on its own; this wine should taste broader and smoother in another six months.

145780,Australia,"High acid, austere fruit mark this cool-climate wine, with aromas and flavors of green apples and peaches.

It's a terroir-driven wine.",Tulum Reserve,86,26.0,Victoria,Mornington Peninsula,,,,,Chardonnay,Willow Creek
145781,Italy,"A clean, crisp nose of green apples with just a hint of almond opens this even, nicely balanced white. It's what a classic Soave is supposed to be—light, dry and refreshing.

145783,Italy,"This wine boasts aromas of saddle leather and black cherries, with just a hint of medical tape. On the palate, the flavors remain true, with cherries and leather predominating, and a slight creaminess.

145789,Australia,"This unusual blend of Sémillon, Chenin Blanc and Sauvignon Blanc is good but isn't for everyone—the bouquet is a garden-fresh blend of gooseberries, green bananas and leafy lettuce; the palate shows clean, zingy green pea and cilantro flavors.

145791,South Africa,"Smoke, game and leather accent the sweet berry fruit.

Finishes tart and smoky.",,86,9.0,Western Cape,,,,,,Pinotage,KWV
145792,Italy,"Sweet aromas of butterscotch, cherry and caramel combine and carry through to the palate along with licorice, toast and minerals.

145793,Australia,"Deceptively light in color, this wine nevertheless packs a wallop, with a hefty 14.5% alcohol.

145794,Italy,"Pineapple, citrus and wet stones greet you on the nose and continue into the long finish, where pineapple takes the lead.

Not as forthcoming as the '99, but no slouch, either.",,86,20.0,Southern Italy,Fiano di Avellino,,,,,Fiano,Feudi di San Gregorio
145795,Italy,"The fresh peaches and pears tinged with citrus develop a slight bitterness on the finish that's something like the skin of an underripe peach.

145796,Italy,"There's oak galore in this medium-weight apple-fruited Piedmont wine. The palate is slightly tart, with tangy oak splayed over a Granny Smith green-apple base. Finishes with decent length, but again propelled more by wood than fruit. Oak lovers will gush over this, and will find more to like about it than this reviewer did.",,86,34.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,,,,Chardonnay,Bastía

145799,Italy,"There's a violet note to the nose and palate that makes you wonder if there's some Viognier in this wine.

145807,US,"Starts with a blast of charry oak, and turns fierce in tannins and acids in the mouth, as well as searingly dry. Somewhere in there is intense black-cherry fruit.

145812,US,"Fans of sheer volume will exult, but this wine, good as it is, is a bit overblown. It overwhelms with oak as well as berry flavor so ripe, it approaches chocolate-coated raisins.

145813,US,"Fascinating to compare this to Provenance's '02 Oakville Cab.

145835,US,"This unusual blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc shows leathery, blackberry, mint and oaky aromas and flavors, and is pretty tannic. It numbs the mouth, but there's a rich core of fruit that may age out.",Integrity,86,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Merlot-Cabernet Franc,Ballentine

145841,Australia,"Here's an understated Riesling, one with subdued flavors and a pretty mineral-flour feel to it.

On the dinner table, it would complement just about any cream-based sauce.",,86,11.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,,,,Riesling,Wynns Coonawarra Estate
145842,US,"Here's a wine that got so ripe, they had to let the alcohol reach an astonishing 16.5% for it to be dry.

145847,France,"This is the label under which Château La Rame —a sweet wine producer in Saint Croix du Mont—commercializes its dry white, made from Sauvignon Blanc. No, it is not a profound wine, but it should be an example to other producers of humble Bordeaux blanc of what can be achieved through care and dedication.

145851,Italy,"Having heard some promising buzz about the 2001 vintage, this wine—one of the first 2001 Barbarescos tasted—was a bit of a disappointment.

145856,South Africa,"Tasty but very dark, even black, with a dense oak veneer over its solid fruit core. The ripe crushed blackberry and blueberry fruit and nutty accents work hard to come forward.

145859,US,"I tasted this wine with a range of other Sauvignon Blancs, all of which cost far more, and it had nothing to be ashamed of. Shows a nice balance of crisp acids and slight oak with well-ripened flavors of citrus fruits, melons and figs. A splash of Sémillon adds a nutty complexity. At this price, from this appellation, it's a steal. Shouldn't be too hard to find, with 5,600 cases produced.",,86,9.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Castle Rock
145860,US,"Soft, ripe and tasty, this fruit-forward Cabernet offers plenty of palate-pleasing currant, cassis, cherry and mocha flavors, along with sweet smoky oak.

145861,Italy,"Berry and cherry aromas get it started, followed by notes of cinnamon and alfalfa.

145862,Italy,"Depth and richness are hinted at by berry aromas with a touch of liqueur. The palate runs snappy and snazzy, with racy but tasty cherry and raspberry fruit.

145868,US,"There's a nice, melony center to this wine, with suggestions of lightly spiced pears and green apples. The fruit is lively and pure, and the wine has a nice lift to it. The spices kick in at midpalate and carry through a long and thoroughly satisfying finish.

145869,Spain,"Zesty as all get out, with a touch of spritz. Full melon, nectarine and green-herb aromas set the stage for apricot, peach and citrus flavors. Hails from Condado do Tea and seems racier than most.",Laxas,89,,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,,,,Albariño,As Laxas
145870,US,"Beaulieu's basic Napa Cab is dry and balanced wine, with the accent on balance. This is a wine that stays in the background, letting food star, but that doesn't mean it's not complex.

145872,South Africa,"Although it comes from despite a cooler climate than Stellenbosch, this wine achieved 14.5% alcohol. But you wouldn't know it, as it has elegant flavors of ripe cherry, plum and chocolate in a beautifully balanced framework. Groot Constantia's reds all have a silky texture, and this one is no different. The nose favors brown sugar and chocolate over muted red berry, but this wine will drink well over the next five years, and possibly beyond.",,89,21.0,Constantia,,,,,,Pinotage,Groot Constantia
145873,US,"Starts off smelling very new-oaky, and as it airs, this Cab Franc-based wine turns aromatic in cherries, cassis, violets and lavender.

The cherries, oak and tannins suggest a good grilled steak.",Justification,89,42.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Justin
145874,Italy,"Smoky and dark, with blackberry as the main fruit-based aroma. This is one deep, ripe, plump red wine; it shows plum, berry and chocolate on the palate, and that's followed by toast, vanilla and fudge.

145876,Italy,"A very good wine from a not-so-good vintage. The bouquet hits firmly with black cherry, almond paste, leather and even a touch of refined horseradish. It's as precise and tight as the palate, which offers tannic but rewarding cherry and plum. A lively, racy, real wine that's playing at the highest level. Holding it to high standards, we find it just short of excellent.",Grotte Rosse,89,40.0,Tuscany,Montecucco,,,,,Sangiovese,Salustri
145877,US,"Classic Russian River Pinot from a warm year. The wine is dry and crispy-soft, if that's not a contradiction, and the cherry and cola fruit is nearly raisined, but stops just short.

145878,US,"Named after the pioneer who settled Alexander Valley, this wine, based on Cabernet Sauvignon, is very dry and pretty tannic right now.

145880,Italy,"A healthy wine with cherry, plum, earth and chocolate on the nose. The fruit is racy, bordering on searing.

Arguably a bit skinny and one-dimensional, but still it's worthy of praise.",Vino di Tavola Rosso,89,78.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,,Sangiovese,Capannelle
145881,Italy,"Potent and alive, kind of rubbery and leathery, with a shot of barnyard thrown in for good measure. Shows solid cherry and berry at the core, but that fruit is offset by hard tannins and overt firmness. Not a lush, modern playboy; more of classic with old-world appeal. Needs time in the glass to unravel.",Sammarco,89,116.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,,Sangiovese,Castello dei Rampolla
145882,Italy,"Quite full and ripe, a sure reflection of a warm year. Dark berry and prune aromas start it off, followed by ripe, oozing, black-fruit flavors.

145886,US,"Dark and plum-colored, with scents of roasted coffee, toast and black fruits. Blackberry and black cherry fruit is lifted by some lemony acids.

145915,Spain,"Regal in presentation, with its faux-metal label and broad-based bottle. And in every edition it's one of Spain's more elegant, serious cavas. Look for slightly toasted, charcoal-based aromas backed by ripe apple and sweet citrus flavors. Very good feel and length. One of Spain's truly consistent high-end bubblies. Imported by Freixnet USA.",Brut Reserva Heredad,89,20.0,Catalonia,Cava,,,,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
145916,Portugal,"This blend of Alfrochiero, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional is a steal at the $7 price. The meaty, peppery, blackberry nose and bouncy, medium-weight palate makes this wine a ringer for a good Côtes-du-Rhône, at a fraction of the price. Even shows good length on the peppery finish. Drink now–2008. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc.",Colheita Seleccionada,89,7.0,Dão,,,,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta de Cabriz
145917,Italy,"A beautiful wine with a pale rose color that shines with golden and reddish highlights, just like the skin of a ripe peach. The nose is a pretty mélange of raspberry, cranberry, white cherry and fresh baked bread. The mouthfeel is deep and penetrating.

145918,US,"The blend is 60-40 Grenache-Syrah, and the name comes from French slang for something that is luxurious, really chic. Sappy, grapy, nicely lifted and vivacious, this is a beautiful mix of fruits in a spectrum from watermelon to strawberry to red plum to raspberry and pie cherry. There's plenty of acid and just a whiff of pepper from the Syrah.",Byzance,89,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Grenache-Shiraz,Brian Carter Cellars
145919,US,"Richer and more refined than in the past, this refreshingly dry wine is  dynamic in lemon and lime, fig and melon flavors leading to an amazingly long, satisfying finish. It has a tingly acidity that's perfect for goat cheese and grilled veggies.",,89,21.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Cakebread
145920,US,"Roughly 140,000 cases were produced, making this (along with the Two Vines) the benchmark budget Merlot for the state, if not the country. These wines are given plenty of cellaring, which helps to soften them up. The style is wide open and flavorful, with broad cherry and berry fruit set against very smooth, chocolatey tannins. The Grand Estates has thicker, more substantial weight and a silky, milk chocolatey finish.",Grand Estates,88,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Merlot,Columbia Crest
145921,Argentina,"Fast becoming one of Argentina's most reliable value brands, Altosur got it right in 2006 with its basic Malbec. The wine is full, chewy, healthy and bright. It has all the attributes of good, young Malbec: plums, berries and chocolate, with lushness and some style.",Altosur,88,11.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,,,,Malbec,Finca Sophenia
145922,Argentina,"Starts out sort of soft and shy, with modest red-fruit aromas. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors get a quick lift from grabby, firm tannins. And by the time this baby hits its groove you're onto a finish defined by a starchy feel and long-lasting Cabernet essence. Airing is this wine's best friend; decant or drink over time.",Luigi Bosca Reserva,88,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Luigi Bosca
145923,US,"This is the kind of PG that makes the variety such a perfect all-purpose white. It's bone dry, with a great crunch of acidity that brightens slightly herbal grapefruit zest, white peach, Meyer lemon and wildflower flavors. Interestingly, the wine did not undergo malolactic, and while it was fermented in stainless steel, it was sur lies aged.",,88,21.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Pinot Grigio,Swanson
145924,Austria,A relatively rare varietal that is believed to originate in the Krems region. This example shows the varietal's high acidity that needs an off-dry flavor to compensate. It has a nice caramel layer which helps in the balance.,Kreimelberg,88,21.0,Niederösterreich,,,,,,Roter Veltliner,Setzer
145925,Italy,"A very characteristic wine of southern Italy, the nose delivers cherry, berry, tobacco, root beer, balsamic, red earth and linseed oil aromas.

145926,Italy,"Vibrant fruit, red apple and blue flowers appear with intensity on the nose to create a racy, clean red wine. The acidity is good, as is the structure, but the 15% alcohol does hit the palate hard.

145927,US,"Primitivo makes up three-fifths of the blend, Petite Sirah most of the rest. It's consistent with past vintages: dark, soft, and plummy.

145928,US,"Really young now, this vineyard block bottling needs a little time to come into its own. Tasted in February, a combination of acidity and bottle shock has made it brittle.

145929,Italy,"Crisp, fruity and full of mineral nuances, this faithfully represents Sardinia's winemaking potential, especially when it comes to easy-drinking white wines.

145932,US,"This is a deep gold, scented with cooked apple and pear, and showing some soft, oxidative character from extended barrel fermentation. It is quite accessible, soft and forward, with light hints of tropical fruits leading into a smooth, lightly toasty finish. Definitely a drink-now Chardonnay.",,88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Chardonnay,Dusted Valley
145933,US,"This is an excellent vintage in Washington, and Bob Bertheau has made a soft, smooth, well-crafted Sauvignon Blanc. Just a bit more than one-third was barrel fermented, and the blend is 100% varietal. It's a fruity, polished effort with citrusy highlights, but I'd love to see the winemaker veer a bit more towards a Washington State-style that includes some sweet grassiness in the finish.",Horse Heaven Vineyard,88,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Chateau Ste.

145935,US,"Lots of acidity in this crunchy wine; this is so tart it's almost like fresh-squeezed lime juice. Fortunately, creamy lees and plenty of new oak add softer, sweeter notes of buttered toast and vanilla.",Chamisal Vineyards,88,24.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Domaine Alfred
145936,Spain,"Plenty of intense new oak sets the nose in a direction toward mint, licorice and black pepper. And that's all good, because the palate backs it up  with prime blackberry and cassis flavors. This is a solid wine with slightly pronounced acids and tannins. Not for those averse to a little grab and kick.",Prios Maximus Crianza,88,26.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,,,,Tempranillo,Bodegas de los Rios Prieto

145938,US,"For my money, this is the most authentic wine that Maryhill makes. It has not been softened, oaked, sweetened and vanilla'd up—it just shows the great fruit and the verticality of nicely ripened grapes.

145939,Italy,"A sophisticated and seductive expression of the Primitivo grape, this Antinori-made Puglian wine boasts thick concentration, fruity extracts, ripe cherry flavors, strawberry and a thick inky appearance.

145941,Spain,"Nicely balanced and a better example of the upside of Navarra than the wines that are based on or include Merlot. The nose shows some herbal character but more deep fruit notes. And in the mouth there's ripe cherry, cassis and plum. Texturally, it's very nice, and when you get down to the nuts and olts it's a very good value.",,88,11.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo,Vega Sindoa
145942,US,"This wine fits the winery style like a comfy old shoe. It feels good, smells good and wears well.

145944,US,"In 2003 the vineyard was going through some changes, and the vintage, the shift in focus and the winemaker's predilection for early picking seemed to conspire to produce a rather thin, austere wine. It's locked up tight, a bit herbal and lean, not yet revealing itself even with aeration. It's one of those mystery wines that you keep coming back to, waiting for the light to blink on.",Klipsun Vineyard,88,30.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Seven Hills

145947,Spain,"Carchelo is at its best in this vintage. This is loaded with wild blackberry and leathery sass, too.

145949,Argentina,"The bouquet is fairly tight, with aromas of coffee, crushed minerals, crude oil and fine herbs. The palate runs snappier than most high-end Malbecs, but it also delivers on the promise of ripeness and black-fruit flavors. Finishes in healthy fashion, with some slickness and speed. Very nice and likely even better with food. 1,000 cases made. Imported by Slocum & Sons.",Edicion Limitada,88,45.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,,,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
145950,US,"Very smooth and harmonious, from its cherry, cocoa and smoke-tinged aromatics through the similarly endowed palate, where licorice and cedar notes add further complexity.

145952,US,"A profoundly deep nose of red and black fruit, with cedar, ginger and nutmeg. The sense of balance and grace is sublime, as layers of cassis, plum and cinnamon keep unfolding.

They emphasize flashy fruit and a pure finish, while eschewing oak and weight. Every restaurant in America should serve this beauty by the glass, and every wine drinker should try it at least once. Impeccable with salads.",Muga,89,9.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,,,,Rosé,Muga
145990,US,"Rich, plush aromas of dark plum and blackberry lead the way in this wine made mostly from old-vine Zinfandel and named after winemaker Nils Venge's old dog, Scout. Full-bodied and brash, with smoky toast and jammy fruit (sounds like breakfast, right?) the wine has enough acidity to give it good balance.",Scout's Honor,89,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Red Blend,Venge
145991,US,"Richly textured and flavorful, this gentle wine has pretty cherry and blackberry notes, as well as eathier ones of tobacco and herbs. Oak adds sweetness, but is not heavy. Some astringent tannins suggest modest aging possibilities.",Le Puzzle,89,45.0,California,Napa,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Newton
145992,US,"A stylish Cab, with ripe aromas and flavors of blackberries, licorice and herbs, wrapped in smoky oak. Drinks dry, polished and smooth. A bit lean, especially considering the vintage, but balanced and elegant.",Heritage Reserve,89,50.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schug
145993,Portugal,"At 10 years of age, Portal's tawny is still showing some rough edges of youth; it's big and brawny, with plump cherry-berry fruit joined by citrus and caramel. A fine café au lait note comes through on the finish.",Ten Year Old Aged Tawny Port,89,24.0,Port,,,,,,Port,Quinta do Portal
145994,Portugal,"Cigar smoke, molasses and dried fig aromas set the stage for a smooth, easy-drinking tawny with layers of tobacco, dried citrus and clove flavors. It's not terribly sweet or lush, but relies on delicate complexity for its appeal.",30-Year Tawny,89,90.0,Douro,,,,,,Port,Ramos-Pinto
145995,Italy,"Smoke, leather and cedar on the nose, with tart cherries and dry tree bark to follow. Finishes long and juicy, with rugged tannins and some chocolaty oak.",,89,59.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,,,,Sangiovese,Castello Banfi
145996,US,"Here's a big, tannic wine that's built solid and tight, and showcases mountain origins. Big, big flavors of blackcurrants, toast, vanilla, smoke and spices carry through on the long finish. Built for ageability.",,89,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mount Veeder
145997,US,"The blend is half Cab and half Merlot and a splash of Syrah; hence the moniker C-M-S. A full 20% of the fruit comes from the winery's vineyards in the Red Mountain AVA. It captures the complexity of far more expensive red blends, with a succinct mix of red fruits, mineral and fresh-roasted coffee-bean flavors. This and the winery's superb blended white wine may be the two best bargains in Washington.",C-M-S,89,10.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Red Blend,Hedges
145998,US,"“Elysium” in Greek mythology is the afterlife of perfect bliss, and it's not hard to imagine this as its house pour. It is sweet—but not shockingly so—with blackberry, orange, vanilla and chocolate flavors, and a richly smooth mouthfeel. If you're treating yourself to something chocolaty, especially if it has oranges or strawberries, this will be a seductive companion.",Elysium,89,10.0,California,California,California Other,,,,Black Muscat,Quady
145999,US,"A wine so well crafted, with such a fine tannic structure, that all it's missing is the richness of fruit to earn a higher score. Opens with earthy aromas that suggest dried hay, sage and dust, although if you really swirl, you'll find underlying traces of cherries. Tastes fruitier than it smells. There's a delicate deliciousness, but it's a wine for the near term.",Reserve,89,55.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sequoia Grove
146000,Portugal,"A big, burly wine with a firmly tannic finish, the 1999 Praemium needs a few years to shed its youthfulness. The subtle toast and vanilla notes are in proportion with the intense blackberry fruit, and it picks up some coffee notes on the finish.",Carm Praemium,89,27.0,Douro,,,,,,Touriga Nacional,Roberedo Madeira
146001,Portugal,"Plums, dusty earth and dried spice mingle on the nose of this older release that actually seems more ageworthy than Portal's 1997 and 1999. It's supple, medium-weight wine, with plum, prune and spice flavors that finish with modest tannins and pleasing berry and spice notes.",Vintage,89,33.0,Port,,,,,,Port,Quinta do Portal
146002,Italy,"Round and smoky, with more modern touches than many riserva-level Brunelli. The bouquet offers sweet fruit, while the palate delivers a full-court press of cherry and raspberry along with firm, hard-hitting tannins. Lively acids and a bit sharp. Not one-dimensional, but not overly complex, either.",Poggio Alle Mura,89,70.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,,,,Sangiovese,Castello Banfi
146003,Portugal,"You get a glimpse of the fine qualities of the 1997 vintage in this bottling, which displays lush black cherry and plum aromas and flavors against a backdrop of supple tannins and a velvety texture. The elements are well integrated, and the finish is long and fruity.",LBV Porto,89,18.0,Portugal,,,,,,Port,Dow's
146004,US,"Extraordinarily tough, tannic and dense, a wine that simply cannot be consumed without proper aging. The tannins are outsized by present day standards, and finish dry and rasping. Yet the wine is saved by an underlying integrity. It's a gamble for the long haul.",Bancroft Ranch,89,80.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
146005,Italy,"This wine is a bit special. It's made mostly of the native Monica grape, which gives off unbridled aromas to go with leathery nuances and wild raspberry flavors. Owner Antonio Argiolas's winemaking team ferments the wine in glass-lined cement tanks for purity, then ages it for 16 months in French oak. Perdera is spicy, precocious and out of the ordinary; best of all, it improves with each minute it's open.",Perdera,89,12.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Isola dei Nuraghi,,,,,Red Blend,Argiolas
146006,Italy,"Vietti, which makes some of Piedmont's most user-friendly wines across the full spectrum of price ranges, scores major points with this light-bodied, sweet frizzante. It smells of gardenias and fresh summer herbs, and it pulses with kiwi, nectarine and pineapple flavor. There's nothing not to like about this low-alcohol (5.5%) liquid dessert—surely the perfect match for ice cream or fruit salad.",Cascinetta,89,12.0,Piedmont,Moscato d'Asti,,,,,Moscato,Vietti
146007,Italy,"Dense to the nose, with spice, mineral, plum and chocolate poking through a veil of lightly applied oak. Roasted stone fruits carry the palate prior to a smooth, chocolaty finish. With full tannins and good acidity, this wine is pure and balanced.",Riserva,89,29.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,,,,Sangiovese,Volpaia
146008,US,"Very smooth and suave, a wine soft in tannins and acids that caresses the palate while carrying ripe flavors of blackberries, currants, cinnamon and smoky oak. Delicious now for its pure primary fruit, and should be perfect with lamb.",,89,15.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sobon Estate
146009,US,"A charming, delicious Cab, with pretty flavors of blackcurrants and spiced plums, and rich, complex tannins. Feels solid and complete in the mouth, and the long, spicy finish is dry. Shows a lot of class and elegance.",,89,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Andretti
146010,New Zealand,"Boasts an alluring bouquet of tea, jasmine and other other floral notes, then adds ample ripe cherry flavors on the palate. Not deep or rich enough to merit an Excellent rating, but a pretty, relatively lightweight wine for early drinking.",Old River Terrace,88,,Wairarapa,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Wycroft
146011,Australia,"This is not a Pinot you'd ever mistake for an Old World version—its palate is brimming with plums, berries and noticeable wood, but it still retains some recognizable varietal character. Soft, dusty tannins give it a good feel. The nose, though, is trail-mix central: granola, dried fruit, dates. Imported by Scott Street Portfolio.",Reserve,88,36.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,,,,Pinot Noir,Yering Station
146012,New Zealand,"Bursting with ripe tropical flavors, lush and fruity. There's just a hint of green herb—enough so that you know it's Sauvignon Blanc—but the emphasis here is on forward fruit.

146013,New Zealand,"A much better value than the more complex Target Gully bottling, this Bannockburn Pinot offers up dark chocolate and cola flavors, blended with treebark and plum.

Imported by American Estates Wines, Inc.",,88,30.0,Central Otago,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Mt. Difficulty
146014,Australia,"This is a crisp, focused Shiraz—not a killer in terms of richness or size, which is part of its draw (particularly if you're looking for something to drink with dinner). It has cool wintergreen and gingerbread aromas, and black cherry fruit on the palate. Finishes off with mint and tobacco flavors. Imported by Conquest Beverage Group.",Director's Cut,88,24.0,South Australia,Langhorne Creek-Limestone Coast,,,,,Shiraz,Heartland
146015,New Zealand,"For Peg Bay's high-end bottling, this is a bit of a disappointment. It offers dried spices and cherries on the nose, then adds sour cherry flavors on the palate. With time, darker cherry flavors emerge, showing a slight element of sur-maturité. It's medium-bodied, with some firm tannins still in evidence. Hold through 2008 and hope for improvement. Imported by Meadowbank Estates.",Prima Donna,88,74.0,Waipara,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Pegasus Bay
146016,Australia,"Smells very nice, just lightly floral and minerally. Starts on the palate with a surge of white peach and citrus, then it lets up midpalate, and comes back for a rousing finish. I really liked this Riesling; without that intensity interruption in the middle, its score would have reached the next decile.

146017,New Zealand,"Brancott's top-of-line Pinot boasts a sappy, creamy texture, combining herbal notes with bright cherry fruit, then adding cola and plum bass notes.

146020,Australia,"This is a very enjoyable Sauvignon, with a zesty profile that is green, but not in the typically limey, Kiwi-inspired way. Here you'll find pleasant aromas of fresh, leafy greens (lettuce, and even some mint) and flavors that reminded me of key lime or lemon meringue pie—citrusy, yes, but certainly not sour. A chalky, dusty feel completes the picture. 2,000 cases produced. Imported by Clos Du Val Wine.",,88,16.0,Victoria,Victoria,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Taltarni
146021,US,"You immediately pick up on the cool-climate origins of this wine. It's all rhubarb and cola, an impression confirmed with the first taste. Acidity stars here, but there are riper flavors of black cherries. Rich tannins, too. The wine is totally dry. It hasn't come together yet. Try aging until 2007.",Cuyama River,88,28.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Taz

146023,US,"From highlands vineyards in Napa's Chiles Valley, this is a young, tough Cab. It has some dry, numbing tannins. Still, there's a heart of blackberry and currant fruit, and good acidity. Try cellaring for a couple years to soften.",,88,38.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Volker Eisele Family Estate
146024,New Zealand,"There's a bit of wood shavings and toast on the nose, but also plenty of ripe black cherries to balance out the new oak.

Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",,88,30.0,Central Otago,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Amisfield
146025,France,"A rich, full-bodied style of wine, which has some caramel flavors as well as white peach flavors.

146026,US,"Somebody picked early, to judge from the slightly green, peppercorn notes. But in a way that adds to the complexity, and makes the wine different. It's not a fruit bomb, it's a coffee, herb and blackberry-flavored dry Merlot with structural integrity.",Reserve,88,20.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,,,,Merlot,Frei Brothers
146027,Australia,"An okay vintage of a typically better wine. The wine is dominated by a nutty, amaretto or liqueurish note, with tangy oak on the finish. There's firm plum fruit and a piquant sweet-tartness that grabs on midpalate, though, that's quite nice. Imported by Foster's Wine Estates Americas.",Padthaway Reserve,88,40.0,South Australia,South Australia,,,,,Shiraz,Greg Norman Estates
146028,New Zealand,"Intriguingly complex aromas of plum, herb and game don't quite follow through on the palate, where the fruit becomes more dominant, delivering superripe blackberry flavors.

146036,US,"This Sauvignon is very New Zealandy in gooseberry, green grass, alfalfa and citrus fruit. It's also totally dry, with good, crisp acids. It has a complex, layered creaminess that lifts it above the ordinary.",,88,15.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,White Oak
146037,US,"I think of this as a softer Rhône equivalent of the Zinfandel-based field blend. With Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Cinsault, there's a spicy, herbal garrigue flavor to the cherry and red raspberry fruit. Crisp acidity and fine, rich tannins make it balanced and appealing and even complex.",Z Cuvee,88,15.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,,,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Zaca Mesa
146038,New Zealand,"While only light ruby in color, this wine doesn't lack for flavor, showing plenty of ripe cherry fruit. It's a bit simple, but it offers a pleasingly silky mouthful of Pinot Noir. Seems like a perfect match for salmon. Imported by Brennans.",Twin Vineyards,87,18.0,Waipara,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Daniel Schuster
146039,Australia,"Smells smoky sweet—like fruitcake, nut and barbecue smoke. On the palate, the wine is narrow, rather than round and mouthfilling, with fresh herb, plum and blackberry flavors dominating. It's a very good wine, but falls short of anything more. Imported by USA Wine West.",The Ashmead Family,87,30.0,South Australia,Barossa,,,,,Shiraz,Elderton
146040,US,"The acids hit you first. They perk up a creamy wine with pleasant flavors of cherries, cola, mocha and spice. It's dry and balanced.

146042,France,"Condrieu also comes in a rarer, sweet style, and here it is, in a wine that is both opulent and exotic. This cuvée de prestige is sweet, certainly, but it has layers of dry botrytis which give it balance. There's also acidity to give the wine a final lift.",Ayguets,90,80.0,Rhône Valley,Condrieu,,,,,Viognier,Yves Cuilleron
146043,France,"This is Cuilleron's top Condrieu, a voluptuous style of wine which is spiced with new wood and packed with flavors of honey, of treacle and white peaches. There is acidity, but it only plays a walk-on part in this big, fat wine.",Les Chaillets,90,85.0,Rhône Valley,Condrieu,,,,,Viognier,Yves Cuilleron
146044,US,"Many Oregon wineries aspire to make Burgundian pinot noir, but few actually do.

146046,US,"No problem getting the fruit ripe, to go by the delicious blackcurrant, cassis, cherry and blueberry flavors that veer into chocolate. Compared to Napa tannins, this one's edgier, sharper. It doesn't have that luscious creaminess. But that may be unfair. It's a really good wine.",Fathom,90,32.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,,,,Red Blend,Babcock
146047,US,"Starts with that telltale pedigree aroma of perfectly ripe blackcurrant and cassis complexed with fine smoky oak.

146048,France,"This wine appears to be in a somewhat dormant phase, only stubbornly revealing hints of violets and bacon on the nose.

146049,Chile,"Even after 14 months in French oak, this wine shows a lot of fruit. Black cherries abound on the nose and palate, accented by mocha, dried spices and a just a hint of herbaceousness.

146050,Italy,"Powerful and poised, with subdued but serious aromas of charred black fruit, raisin and coffee. Ripe but linear, with intense pie cherry, rhubarb and blackberry flavors.

146055,Italy,"Pretty and light, with dried fruit, herbs, belt leather and a distant woodsy scent.

146057,US,"A proprietary name for a barrel select reserve. Round and sweetly fruity, it's easy to see why these 12 barrels stood out from the pack.

Two thirds new oak lends a tasty vanilla element to the finish.",Delara,89,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,,,,Pinot Noir,Maysara

146066,Italy,"A large, complex, forceful wine that requires time to show off. What starts out murky, heavy and clumsy becomes more lovable once it gets some air.

146071,Italy,"A riserva Gaglioppo, this wine is characterized by dry fruit, tea and tobacco flavors. An earthy nuance brings the curtain down. Medium bodied and well-balanced, the mouthfeel is smooth. This fully mature wine is ready for drinking now. With it, the Calabrese recommend a spicy sausage from Calabria…and why not?",Duca Sanfelice Riserva,86,13.0,Southern Italy,Calabria,,,,,Gaglioppo,Librandi
146072,Australia,"There's a lot going on in this simple Cab-Shiraz. Aromas of earth, cherry and Sweet Tarts pave the way for white pepper, plum and fresh cedar on the palate. Medium-full, with nice balance, the wine finishes with a zippy (but not too hot) black pepper note. An easy mainstream sell.",,86,8.0,South Australia,South Australia,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,Oxford Landing
146073,Italy,This wine has pure apple and pear fruit that's reminiscent of an unoaked Chardonnay. It's well balanced and the mouthfeel is round and more ample than the delicate color and aromas would suggest. A mild citrus-peel bite on the finish makes it fresh and appealing.,,85,10.0,Northeastern Italy,Friuli,,,,,Pinot Grigio,Campanile
146074,Italy,"Not a vaudeville act, but the second edition of a new wine. The name refers to the wine's mixture—Pino for Pinot Bianco (25%) and Pinot Grigio (15%) and Toi for Tocai (60%). That said, the wine starts with lovely grapefruit, pear and almond scents. On the palate, there is good weight, lively acidity and a viscous mouthfeel. The finish, however, is somewhat short with an unusual petrol-like note.",Pino & Toi,85,11.0,Veneto,Veneto,,,,,White Blend,Maculan
146075,Australia,"With its forward fruit and touch of toasty oak, this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot is soft and easy to like. There's a sweetness to the cherry, vanilla and cassis flavors, which are supported by bright acididty. The easy structure yields a juicy mouthfeel.",,85,13.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Hope Estate

146077,Australia,"This is a little soft and low–acid but the fruit aromas and flavors are quite pleasant, with pineapple and grapefruit predominating. There's some weightæeven a succulent quality—to the fruit that keeps the flavor and texture lingering on the back end.",Estate Bottled,85,10.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Rosemount
146078,Australia,"Rosemount's new offering opens with a pleasant vanilla, oak and dark berry fruit nose. On the palate, the fruit takes a backseat to dominant wood. Oak and cedar flavors reign here. It's a little high in acid and tannins to be an easy drinker, and it finishes long and dry with a tart edge. Try with grilled sausages.",Hill of Gold,85,19.0,New South Wales,Mudgee,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rosemount
146079,Australia,"A bright citrus-herb nose opens this Sauvignon Blanc with distinct style and character. Grapefruit, lime, lemon peel and green grassy flavors unfold on the round medium-full palate, but the herbaceous element is assertive,  and continues to come to the fore with time in the glass. Fans of this style will find this a winner; if that's not you, you probably won't.",,85,15.0,Western Australia,Frankland River,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Alkoomi
146080,Australia,"Almost seems wooded, with strong aromas of toast, caramel and cinnamon that fight for prominence with tart lime fruit.

146081,Australia,"The intense nose of this white Rhône varietal wine offers flower-shop and orange notes and an almost Gewürztraminer-like spiciness. Similar tart-sweet flavors prevail on the medium-weight palate, and high, almost cutting—acidity shows. The spicy finish has a bitter note and decent length. Unique and recommended for the adventurous palate.",,85,16.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,,,,Viognier,Yalumba
146082,Italy,"Aromas of strawberries and milk chocolate gradually turn a bit grassy with air until a green-hay note takes hold. Light and tart, the bouncy red berries and cream flavors persist through the finish. Nice pasta red.",,85,10.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,,Sangiovese,Baroncini
146083,Australia,"This tawny-black Riverland offering has a Port-like bouquet of stewed fruit, mulling spices and smoked meat. Superripe (perhaps overripe) blackberry fruit stars in the mouth, with ancho chile and black pepper flavors in supporting roles. This chewy Petit Verdot is, as the song goes, a bit too “Hot Hot Hot,” but is still an enjoyable drink.",,85,40.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Petit Verdot,Bookpurnong Hill
146084,Australia,"Light lemon and cream, plus heavy oak aromas lead into a slightly hot, apple-cidery palate.

Will please a wide audience.",,85,20.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,,,,Chardonnay,Heggies Vineyard
146085,Italy,"This Pinot Grigio has a nice heft to it. The lime, lemon peel and apple flavors are lively and full. A biscuity, bread-dough note on the nose and palate adds some dimension. A hint of bitter almond livens up the finish.",,85,14.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,,,,Pinot Grigio,Conti Formentini

146087,Australia,"This dry and racy wine begins with a bang: grapefruit, passion fruit, pear and fig scents burst from the glass. Turns tart on the palate, with lemon accents over fig, citrus and hay flavors. The finish is tangy with a slightly bitter citrus-pith note.",Diamond Label Bottled,85,10.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Sémillon,Rosemount
146088,Australia,"Like the label says, no oak has touched this wine. All you get is pure fruit, and dry, high acid fruit, at that. The flavors veer toward citrus with a hint of peach, and the acidity is very high. Elegant, crisp, and refreshing, it finishes with a slight burn.",Unoaked,85,18.0,Victoria,Mornington Peninsula,,,,,Chardonnay,Willow Creek
146089,Italy,"Musky aromas and flavors of melon and nectarine turn tart and lemony on the palate. The perfect setting for this wine: New York's San Gennaro festival, washing down clams from a mobile raw bar.",,84,11.0,Tuscany,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,,,,,Vernaccia,Cecchi
146090,Italy,"Lean, sharp and herbal, this is a true apéritif wine that whets the appetite. A slight sour-cream note on the palate is offset by a tangy citrus-laden finish that blends in some cinnamon-spiced pear flavors.",,84,19.0,Piedmont,Gavi di Gavi,,,,,Cortese,La Scolca
146091,Australia,"This blend of 78% Grenache and 22% Shiraz shows surprisingly light fruit.

146092,Italy,"This crisp, clean white is filled with tart green apple and lime aromas and flavors. Throw in hints of almonds and herbs and a slightly creamy texture, and this represents a patio wine supremo.",,84,13.0,Piedmont,Gavi di Gavi,,,,,Cortese,Sant'Evasio
146093,Australia,"American oak can smell like cloves, and this wine, which was aged in American oak, does, along with meat, chocolate and blackberries. It's juicy in the mouth, with some numbing tannins. A little earthy and rough around the edges, and finishes with an almond-skin bitterness.",,84,15.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Merlot,Owen's Estate
146094,Australia,"This wine reads like a sexy but aloof woman: Ruby-colored at the lips, on the thin side and corset-tight. What little perfume she wears (this you only detect after a number of swirls, twirls and minutes in the glass) has promising notes of cream and anise. Oak and black pepper in the mouth; medium-length black pepper and grape finish.",Percydale,84,15.0,Victoria,King Valley,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Redbank
146095,Australia,"This wine's sweet edge will please those who haven't yet grown to appreciate complex Cabs. Aromas of mushrooms and wet soil burn off to reveal a sugary, grapey bouquet. Oak and an herbal, tarragon-like flavor dominate the palate; finishes with smoke and a sweet, Port-flavored candy taste.",,84,22.0,Victoria,King Valley,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,Wood Park
146096,Argentina,"Overt and akin in some ways to Gewurztraminer. Flowery, lemony and fairly ebullient. Driving acidity keeps it fresh, and it tails away with a dry, soda-like snap. But drink soon; it's not getting younger.",,84,,Other,Cafayate,,,,,Torrontés,Etchart
146097,Italy,"Breganze is a village in the hills north of Venice. The grapes, Tocai and Pinot Bianco, also come from Breganze—hence the wine's name. The bouquet is primarily pear with some petrol in the distance. Good balance and weight, together with the crisp acidity and an oily mouthfeel, complete the structure. The finish is long with some almond and petrol notes.",Breganze di Breganze,84,15.0,Veneto,Veneto,,,,,White Blend,Maculan

146100,Spain,"Hailing from a more obscure mountainous region, this Chardonnay-based white blend is a potent brew.

146102,US,"This is a big wine, but it shows considerable finesse. Pours inky black, and explodes in mulberry, cassis, coffee and herb flavors that are very dry.

146104,US,"I like this wine a lot for the fruity flavors, rich tannins, subtle oak, crispness, long finish and overall balance.

146105,Spain,"Impeccably clean, with light tropical fruit gracing the bouquet.

Perfectly good but not overly flavorful.",Pazo Piñeiro,88,35.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,,,,Albariño,Lusco
146106,US,"This is a wine rich in oak, flavorful berry-cherry flavors and sturdy tannins. It's young now, with a rather rasping mouthfeel, but is balanced.

146107,US,"Quite a lush Syrah. It's perfectly ripened and brimming with black cherry, blackberry and chocolate flavors, but has complexity in the smooth tannins and polished overlay of oak. Finishes dry and long. Try with short ribs.",,88,30.0,California,Carmel Valley,Central Coast,,,,Syrah,Joullian
146108,Spain,"Sweet and grapy on first look, but shows more complexity once you get into it. Rich plum and other black fruits carry the bulky, sizable palate. The finish offers oak in the form of chocolate and mocha. Devoid of serious nuance and depth, but charming in an easy, fruit-forward way.",Albares,88,11.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,,,,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
146109,Spain,"Leathery and smoky, with woodsy aromas as well as the essence of dried red fruits. Like many classic Rioja, it's a touch racy and acidic, but that zest pushes the cherry, cranberry and raspberry fruit toward an even finish. As a whole it's snappy, with a solid core.",Coto Real Reserva,88,42.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,,,,Tempranillo Blend,El Coto
146110,Spain,"The crude oil of PX Sherries, Noe won't appeal to everyone. For starters, it's thick as molasses, with heavy caramel and toffee aromas and flavors.

146115,Spain,"There's not a region or grape type that Telmo Rodríguez won't tackle, and here he's on to Moscatel in the deep south. This wine exhibits lilac aromas with hints of smoked ham and hard cheese. It's not a perfect bouquet, but it is intriguing. In addition, look for a bulky but rewarding palate featuring chewy sweet fruit and moderate acidity.",Molino Real Mountain Wine,88,48.0,Andalucia,Málaga,,,,,Moscatel,Telmo Rodríguez
146116,US,"A controversial wine with our panel. Some loved it for its idiosyncratic aromas and thick, unctuous mouthfeel, while others penalized it for the same characteristics. One reviewer's complex, hard-to-describe aroma was canceled out by another's earthy, mulchy scents. There is a solid core of peach and pineapple fruit, so on balance, our rating is positive.",Vielles Vignes Estate,88,38.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Signorello
146117,US,"This single-vineyard, single-variety bottling tastes like it was poured right out of the barrel. It sports the sort of firm, nuanced flavors that winemakers look for: clean varietal fruit with highlights of iron filings, gravel and pepper.

146122,Italy,"Hints of citrus and yeasty bread define the nose. Next in line is a simple, clean pear-and-white grapefruit palate. As for feel, it's a bit thick and creamy, while the finish is open and clean. Not overpowering but solid.",Desiderio Jeio Brut,87,15.0,Veneto,Veneto,,,,,Prosecco,Bisol
146123,Italy,"Clean and encouraging even if it lacks that true Prosecco nose of lime and slate. Here you get apple and vanilla aromas before fresh apple, pear and cinnamon flavors.

146124,France,"A full, very low-acid wine, thanks to the hot summer. To compensate, though, there are fine wood and tropical fruit flavors, which lend spice and an exotic element to the wine.

146125,Spain,"Kicks off with a bouquet akin to chocolate-covered cherries before moving on to cured meat and bacon.

Shows much of what's good about this appellation.",Reserva,87,24.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,,,,Tempranillo,Valdubón
146126,US,"Very soft, smooth and rather thick, this is one of those Pinots that flatters with scads of ripe fruit and toasty oak.

146127,Spain,"Begins with tight sulfuric aromas that transform into rubber and red fruit. Flavors of cherry, plum and dried herbs are tart and precise, while the finish offers some tomato.

146128,Spain,"This well-priced red from Tarragona shows a glimpse of what the Montsant region can produce. The nose is all red fruit, with a splinter of oak. The palate is chunky and easy as it deals blackberry and raspberry in spades. Chocolate and mocha on the thick finish should please the sugar mavens.",,87,12.0,Catalonia,Montsant,,,,,Red Blend,Fra Guerau
146129,US,"I think this wine has a future, but right now it's in one of those middle-aged funks. It's ripe in cherries, bright in acids, and smooth, but has a certain flatness. It's a gamble, but check it out in another two or three years.",Allen Vineyard,87,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
146130,France,"Boasts some interesting aromas of clove and black pepper, balanced by blackberry and cherry flavors. Nicely proportioned and well structured, with mild tannins and decent acidity; it's not a blockbuster—just a satisfying accompaniment to simply prepared red meats.

146135,US,"My one non-Oz wine is this rosé; it falls more into the “light red” than “pink-colored white” category, in terms of weight and flavor.

146138,US,"Gina is a second label from the esteemed Flora Springs Winery, of Napa Valley. This wine bears much in common with FS's barrel-fermented Chards. It's richly textured, with tropical fruit flavors and a plastering of smoky, vanilla-infused oak. It was even barrel fermented. The texture is as creamy as a milkshake, and there are all sorts of dusty Oriental spices on the finish. It's a little sweet.",,86,10.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Gina

146155,France,"Why does nobody think about dry white Bordeaux? Blended from Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, it is a delicious white wine bargain. And Château Bonnet is one of the best examples. Made in the Entre-deux-Mers region by André Lurton, whose family seems to own or manage half of Bordeaux, it is full of flavors of orange and apricot with a touch of grapefruit to provide the freshness. There is a light toast character to round it off.",,86,11.0,Bordeaux,Entre-Deux-Mers,,,,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Bonnet

146160,US,"One of the more evolved examples, Hamacher's 2000 Pinot Noir should be consumed over the next year or two, although it's possible other bottles may show differently (Hamacher felt there was something “off” with this bottle).

146161,South Africa,"From a region renowned for its dessert wine comes this easy-to-love white. Despite a lightness to the medium body, this wine has plenty of guts, evident in the liquid gooseberry mouth mixed with lime and dusted with chalk.

146162,Italy,"Kendall-Jackson's super Tuscan is Cab-based and very ripe. It's black as coal, with leather, earth and dark-fruit aromas.

146163,US,"From the hot hot 2003 vintage, this has a bit more sweet ripe fruit than the 2004s. It's showing light cranberry/cherry flavors just trickling into LifeSaver candy, and backed with moderate tannins and a green tea astringency.

146164,France,"Morey is better known for white wines, but this villages-level red is no slouch. It's silky and medium-bodied, with baking spices layered over plum and cherry fruit. Turns a bit cedary on the finish, where tea-like tannins grab hold.",,88,33.0,Burgundy,Monthélie,,,,,Pinot Noir,Pierre Morey
146165,New Zealand,"Not that expressive on the nose, but does offer some lightly floral aromas and hints of cinnamon and mushroom.

Picks up some briary complexity on the firm finish.",Doctor's Creek Reserve,88,26.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Saint Clair
146166,Spain,"A year and a half ago this wine came acorss ripe, robust and not the least bit rustic. But now it's showing many signs of the hot 2003 vintage, including a soft structure and some stewy, leather notes.

146167,South Africa,"Burnished gold, even the nose is creamy, offering heavily oaked aromas of caramel, toast and vanilla that neatly encase citrus and peach pit. Oak leads the way in the mouth as well, although there are plenty of citrusy fruits along with peach mineral.

Surely a wine to cellar for up to a decade.",,88,20.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,,,,Tempranillo,Abacela

146173,US,"Good Cab from a hot vintage in a hot valley. The wine sure is ripe, with cassis and plum flavors dusted with cocoa, and dry, with enough tannins to leave the palate puckery.

146179,South Africa,"A great value in Viognier, thanks to moderate use of oak, which also brightens the fruit in this wine. It has vibrant citrus in the mouth, with cantaloupe and a hint of vanilla from older oak. The aromas are similar, with some honeysuckle, while the body is full and creamy, despite racy acids. The alcohol (15.5%) shows through a bit on the finish, but overall a harmonious wine. Imported by Cape Classics.",,88,14.0,Coastal Region,,,,,,Viognier,Brampton
146180,France,"This is tough as nails right now, but also packed with almost liqueur-like black cherry fruit. Meaty nuances and chocolate-fudge richness are stopped abruptly by firm, astringent tannins on the finish.

146182,Spain,"You won't find a better, more affordable Bierzo than this. It carries true terroir, heft and solidity but it's not that complicated or racy.

The harmonious balance suggests this wine will maintain its character throughout this decade.",,88,24.0,Stellenbosch,,,,,,Chardonnay,Mulderbosch
146185,Italy,"Nice and smoky, with a solid, healthy nose that covers the bases. Good and snappy on the tongue, where zest and sweetness convene and deliver cherry, vanilla and chocolate flavors.

One hundred percent varietal, it puts the lie to the notion that cabernet franc must be tannic and tough.

146208,Australia,"This is a young Cab, not meant to be drunk for another 3–5 years at least. At this stage, it takes a long time in the glass to reveal its black cherry, eucalyptus and soil flavors; its tealike tannins reign for now.

Ripe and forward in cherry-berry, tobacco, rum baba, coffee and crushed hard spices, it finishes long and dry.",Reserve,88,30.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Zinfandel,Rodney Strong
146235,Argentina,"Here's a nice wine that pushes the right buttons while not raising any red flags. Raspberry and vanilla flavors are solid and pleasing, while the medium-weight palate features depth and balance. This is not the richest, most overpowering Malbec you'll find, but it comes from 75-year-old vines and its virtues far outdistance its faults.",Reserve Organic,88,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,,,,Malbec,Caligiore
146236,Italy,"Late-harvest,  with beautiful luminosity and aromas of stone peach, apricot, vanilla and light toast. Bright acidity  leaves the palate clean and refreshed. With 5.3 grams of residual sugar, you'll also taste its perky sweetness.",Vendemmia Tardiva,88,48.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Isola dei Nuraghi,,,,,Vermentino,Capichera
146237,US,"This is a clear step up from the excellent Two Vines Shiraz, and worth the extra couple of bucks. Wild berry flavors and varietal spice are given a somewhat tannic, earthy frame. Flavors suggest graphite, moist soil and some textural, grainy tannins. It's substantial, not just simple and fruity, and offers a lot of depth for the price.",Grand Estates,88,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Shiraz,Columbia Crest
146238,Argentina,"Quite earthy and ripe, as tree bark, leather and prune make up the bouquet. The mouth is lively and snappy, with red fruit taking over and holding reign. Sheer, zesty and juicy describes the mouthfeel, while overall the wine delivers depth and integrity. Not overly complex but very good and straightforward.",,88,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Aleph
146239,Hungary,"What a lovely wine this is from Hungary, with its heady cedar/cigarbox and plum aromas and elegant, plush flavors.

146240,Spain,"Rarely do you find musclebound, intense reds priced at $8 that are this good. But Luzon manages to give you a 65/35 blend of Monastrell and Syrah that is lively, loaded and eminently likable. It's all about hefty black fruit, bold tannins and flash. Only 5,000 cases made.",,88,8.0,Levante,Jumilla,,,,,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón
146241,Australia,"This full-bodied wine could use a touch more lushness in the midpalate to help carry its assertive flavors of blackberries and chocolate. Mouthwatering fruit on the finish is backed by firm tannins, suggesting at least a few years of cellaring potential. Would go nicely with grilled steak. Multiple U.S. Importers.",The Rascal,88,24.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,,,,Shiraz,Hugh Hamilton
146242,US,"The addition of 5% Grenache and 4% Viognier—roughly the same as last year's excellent wine—enhances this fruity, forward, well-built Syrah. It's a light, open and attractive style; fragrant, varietal and effusively fruity. Don't look for power or mass here; it's all up front. This is quite delicious.",,88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Syrah,Waterbrook
146243,US,"A good example of the principle that you get what you pay for, this regional Pinot is almost as good as Siduri's Rosella's Vineyard botting. It's dry, crisp and silky, with delicious cola, cherry, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. It lacks the concentration of the single-vineyard Pinot, but is beautiful now.",,88,32.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Siduri
146244,Spain,"Brutal heat didn't do a lot for Mas La Plana in 2003. While still a worthy wine, this one shows some green on the nose and palate, while the balance is weightier than normal. In its favor, there's bold blackberry and a touch of cola on the palate. Good but not up to the wine's usual high standards.",Mas La Plana,88,50.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Torres
146245,US,"Tight, bright and spicy, with light peach flavors under fresh herb. There's a slight and interesting taste of fennel that lingers in the back of the palate. Though under 12% alcohol, this does not come across as sweet, but rather as a racy, food-friendly and distinctive effort.",,88,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,White Riesling,Barnard Griffin
146246,Italy,"Here's an interesting Cabernet Franc-Merlot blend that boasts cooler, green aromas of cut grass, dill, bell pepper and small forest berries. The intensity of the flavors is good and graceful, without ever seeming heavy.",Calcara Vecchia,88,28.0,Southern Italy,Puglia,,,,,Red Blend,Alberto Longo
146247,Austria,"Loess soil, fine silt derived from glacial deposits, is the core characteristic of the Wagram vineyards. With Riesling's ability to take its varietal flavor from the soil, this wine shows richness and opulence, while still keeping close to fresh apples and spice flavors. It's young, but already drinkable.",Vom Gelben Löss,88,22.0,Donauland,,,,,,Riesling,Josef Ehmoser

146250,US,"A sure crowd-pleaser in that it delivers nothing but wholesome, likable aromas and flavors. It's rustic enough to have its own personality while still sticking close enough to what we expect from Napa Cabernet: black fruit, coffee, even some cinnamon. Now it's tightly wound, so give it a few years and you will be amply rewarded with a very fine wine.",,92,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Keenan
146251,US,"Ultraripe berry, herb, cedar, and toast aromas. Refined plum, licorice, and coffee flavors show great appeal, and the supple, elegant mouthfeel plays into the finish with dark fruit and cocoa-powder notes.

146252,US,"Full, with lots of structure, this offers concentrated grape and blackberry aromas that open to black-currant and cedar-spice flavors. A fine fruit-acid balance on the full, even palate keeps it lively, even in its fairly youthful and closed state.

146253,US,"Berries, toast, pepper and chocolate form a fairly complex set of aromatics. Plum, cherry and a certain earthiness are supported by a nice touch of cedar.

146254,US,"Excellent cool-country Cabernet at a good price. It has layers and layers of deep fruit, rich and chocolaty plum flavors, and an ultraplush mouthfeel.

146255,US,"Very tasty and large in scale, it sports a huge nose of dark plum and heavy cedar, along with cinnamon and vanilla accents wrapped in very toasty oak. Very dark fruit with licorice shadings and an elegant, supple mouthfeel add to the appeal. The dark flavors and heavy toast continue on the long finish, which doesn't want to quit.",Clone 6,92,130.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaulieu Vineyard
146256,US,"For this winery's ""basic"" Cabernet, it shines brightly. Dark red berries get just the right spice and licorice accents.

Finishes toasty, with just the slightest streak of mint.",,92,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
146257,US,"An offshoot label of Far Niente. This is one of four new Nickel & Nickel single-vineyard Cabernets.

146258,US,"Cassis liqueur, blueberry notes and a smoky cured-meat element comprise the nose of this engaging, beautifully balanced offering. Dried cherry, cedar, tea and tobacco flavors predominate, and the texture is supple. The long finish displays handsome cherry and coffee notes, with plentiful but even tannins.

146259,US,"Floral, exciting and chocolaty, this is a dense, rich, well-crafted beauty. Yummy is one of the best ways to describe it.

146263,US,"Cassis and cream on the nose, and also a strong hint of menthol. It's a large wine, emphasizing black-currant and plum flavors, a smooth wood-driven finish, and even some mint.

146265,US,"Another wine in what we have come to call the “black-beauty” style. It has heavily toasted oak, espresso, black cherry and menthol aromas and flavors. The fruit seems subdued here, but the wine is nevertheless well integrated, with a full mouthfeel and long finish.

146266,US,"A youthful, exciting wine that offers plenty of earth and cassis. It seems tight and closed now, with packed in tannins, a condensed mouthfeel and some mild green pepper notes on the tail end. Definitely a wine for the cellar. Give it some time and it should open up its wings.",,92,65.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Staglin
146267,US,"If you like an exotic, intriguing nose, here it is: cloves, tobacco, cardamom and cinnamon. Cherries, plums, red currants and anise fill the mouth.

146271,US,"Deep, pungent aromas of sweet fruit and bramble mark the nose of this solid, full-scale wine. Full-throttle cherry flavors, with licorice, tobacco and dark-chocolate accents reign on the palate. The silky, elegant texture makes it almost too easy to like.

146276,US,"Rich aromas of cherry, mint, cedar, and vanilla open this forward and inviting wine. Plum, spice, and sweet chocolate flavors with a dusty earth quality mark the palate.

Good now through 2006.",Hilltop Vyd,91,33.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,J. Lohr
146277,US,"A fine wine at the bottom of the ultrapremium price category. There's some bramble and forest aromas in advance of jammy cherry and blackberry fruit.

Oaky, in a Bordeaux manner, and very elegant.",,91,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peju
146280,US,"This Bordeaux blend has some good flavors of blackcurrants, tobacco and herbs, and has rich, soft tannins and a good grip on the palate. It is very dry, and has layers of complexity.

146283,US,"This top-tier release from Reynolds is the hardest of the four new releases. It has a firm streak of metallic acidity and the tannins are somewhat aggressive, limiting the palate's ability to enjoy the underlying blackberry and currant flavors. It is not as immediately enjoyable as the Estate Select, but has greater longterm prospects.",Reserve,89,78.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Reynolds Family Winery
146284,US,"It took the utmost talent to succeed in this vintage, when rains hampered so many late-ripening reds. Mondavi did their best to rise above this.

146285,Australia,"I regret that I didn't rate this wine a point or two higher when I reviewed it for the February 2003 issue. Since last winter, I've purchased nearly a case of it. It's smooth and warming, with lovely nut, beef and butterscotch flavors. I know what you're thinking: At $17, is it really such a value? Quality Port, my friends, doesn't come cheap.

146286,US,"From Jim Fetzer, a wine from biodynamically grown grapes, and a study in progress.

146288,Italy,"A refreshing yet substantive white from the island of Sicily. The blend is 20% Chardonnay, 20% Sauvignon Blanc and 60% Inzolia. With dry, focused aromas and ripe citrus flavors, it's the quintessential wine to pair with Mediterranean classics such as olives, salads and seafood. The estate, which spans nearly 1,000 acres including olive groves, is named after a 12th-century abbey. This wine is a winner.",Bianco di Passomaggio,88,14.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,,,,White Blend,Abbazia Santa Anastasia
146289,Italy,"This Southern Italian wine fits more into the mold of traditional than modern. By that we mean it's lean, elegant and not overly extracted.

Look for flavors of rhubarb, cranberry and cherry along with hints of raisin and earth.",Riserva Vigna Flaminio,88,10.0,Southern Italy,Salice Salentino,,,,,Red Blend,Agricole Vallone
146290,France,"Fruity and fresh, this wine is as packed with grapes and cherries as a wine can be, yet still picks up hints of plum and chocolate on the finish, imparting added complexity.

146291,Italy,"Some wines are modern in style; others more traditional. Put this aromatic Puglian blend of 85% Negroamaro and 15% Malvasia Nera in the latter category. There's no bulk, heavy extract or pounding oak; just aromas of lavender, flower petals and citrus rind accompanying racy raspberry fruit accentuated by sharp acids. Any rawness will be tamed by pizza, pasta or a chunk of hard cheese.",Riserva,88,10.0,Southern Italy,Salice Salentino,,,,,Red Blend,Cantele
146292,Argentina,"On the nose, smooth berry aromas turn chocolaty courtesy of the high-toast barrels used. In the mouth, the plump fruit seems up to the oak. There's raspberry and raisin, and some blueberry, too. For the curious, Altos de Medrano is the winery and hormigas, in Spanish, are ants. Fortunately, I've seen no such critters at the winery.",,88,9.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,,,,Malbec,Altos Las Hormigas
146293,New Zealand,"Pinot Gris is quickly becoming the hot white grape in New Zealand, and this is a fine example. Ripe, honeyed pear and apple fruit provides plenty of weight, but there's also crisp acidity to provide balance. Going by taste alone, it may have a touch of residual sugar to help round out the mouthfeel and counter the zesty acids, but the hint of sweetness will only make it partner even better with many Asian dishes.",,88,15.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Pinot Gris,Omaka Springs

146295,US,"This one-wine brand was minutes away from folding a year ago, but a drop in price and a series of superb vintages for Washington Merlot made some great juice available. Unlike most Merlots under $20, this one is not just light and fruity. It offers rich, true flavors of ripe cherries, followed by layers of milk chocolate, toast and spice. Unfortunately, although 2,800 cases were made, distribution is limited to the West Coast.",,88,10.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,,,,Merlot,Randall Harris

146297,Australia,"A fruity, balanced red from an ever-reliable producer. Firm red plum and cherry fruit has grip on the palate; it's medium-bodied, with oak and nut flavors, and ginger-nut accents on the nose. It's noticeably more sophisticated—less sweetness, less vanilla, more heft—than most Shiraz-Cabs in the under-$10 category.",Red Label,88,12.0,South Australia,South Australia,,,,,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Wolf Blass

146299,Italy,"Smooth and stylish enough, with hints of bold black fruit, earth and dill. The flavor profile runs a touch candied, with ripe but sweet berry and plum.

146301,France,"Jean Chanfreau's family, which owns Châteaux Fonréaud and Lestage in Listrac, produces this blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, giving a wine with plenty of Cabernet cassis flavors, but also a roundness and spiciness that sit well with firm tannins. Lovers of young Bordeaux will find it ready to drink now, but it has a good five years before complete maturity.",,88,17.0,Bordeaux,Listrac,,,,,Red Blend,Château Fonréaud
146302,Portugal,"Already showing hints of brown at the rim and the beginnings of decay on the nose, this is still eminently drinkable, especially if you prefer a little age on your Port.

146303,France,"Brun packs a lot of complexity into this wine. Briary, stemmy aromas add a wild touch to the crystalline black fruit, and those same elements re-emerge on the long finish.

146304,Italy,"Muscular and power-packed, with a deep-purple tint, saturated berry aromas and a strong whack of oak. The mouth is deep, dense and chock full of blackberry, chocolate, coffee and cinnamon. No complaints about the richness and fruit quotient, but it's arguably too oaky. Should improve with time.",Cerviolo Rosso,88,65.0,Tuscany,Tuscany,,,,,Sangiovese,San Fabiano Calcinaia

146306,Italy,"Dark and powerful, with plenty of tight-grained oaky notes, hickory and black fruit on the nose.

146307,France,"Guy Ricard of Domaine le Couroulu believes his 2000 vintage made wines that will “appeal very quickly.” While his main production is of Vacqueyras, where his cellar is located, he also has vineyards in the Côtes du Rhône appellation. This wine confirms his prediction about 2000: It is ripe, with perfumed aromas and raspberry flavors. Sweet, soft tannins and concentrated fruit make it a great value.",,88,10.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône,,,,,Red Blend,Domaine le Couroulu

Tannins are bitter, like a cup of oversteeped breakfast tea. Drink soon, before the fragile fruit disappears.",,83,23.0,Tuscany,Carmignano,,,,,Sangiovese,Capezzana
146394,Italy,"Light-to medium bodied, this Chardonnay is characterized by a strong floral-herb note that shows early.

146396,Australia,"If you've been inside a natural food store, you've already experienced this Petite Sirah. The nose has olive-y, earthy, green-produce notes; the palate shows similarly organic-tasting, fresh earthy elements. Finishes short, with a slight tang.

146397,Australia,"Slight berry and carob notes compete with woody and herbaceous aromas on the nose of this light wine.

146398,Australia,"Banana, cream and a hint of cilantro characterize this Verdelho's nose. The palate is, at first, bright and lively with hints of cream; a split second later, it is supertart. Finish is bitter, with an odd metallic flavor.",,83,14.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,,,,Verdelho,Abbey Vale

146404,US,"105 cases of this Bordeaux blend were produced, and the wine is soft and fruity, with a nice mix of red berry, black cherry, and some smoke and toast.

146407,US,"Not half the wine of the remarkable '97. Smells oaky and of black cherries. Taste of dried herbs, cherries, coffee. Dry, with a chunky, chewy mouhtfeel and unresolved, awkward tannins.

146414,US,"A challenging wine. Rather raw and heavy out of the bottle, but benefits greatly with long decanting. Then, the cherry and cassis fruit opens up. But it's still a young, hard wine.

146429,Spain,"Thinning, but with catchy aromas of leather, citrus peel, forest floor and cola. The palate offers sweeping dried fruits, mostly cassis and cherry.

Interestingly, root beer and turnip show up at the very end.",Gran Reserva,87,23.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,,,,Tempranillo,Montecillo
146430,Italy,"Cherry, citrus rind and oak make for a short, stout nose. It seems more precise on the palate, with pure cherry and coffee flavors poking through a veil of tight tannins.

146431,Italy,"Reticent for a 2001. The nose is leathery, with more smoked meat and tomato than bright fruit. Quite classical in style, blending 70% Sangiovese with 30% Cabernet. Tart cherry and cranberry control the palate, which has a nice center cut of fruit but not a lot of obvious charm. More of a connoisseur's wine than mainstream juice.",Campaccio Selezione Riserva,88,72.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,,Sangiovese,Terrabianca

146433,Italy,"A surprisingly good show for a soggy vintage, this is ripe, bordering on stewy, with rich notes of prune, blueberry, mushroom and forest floor.

146434,US,"This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sauvignon Gris is all barrel-fermented—the trick is that only 30% of the barrels are wood, the rest are stainless steel. The result is a complex, multifaceted Sauvignon that's meant to pay homage to white Graves.

146436,New Zealand,"Having now tasted this wine on three separate occasions, I'm certain it will continue to improve in the bottle, but how stingy my current rating will ultimately seem is an open question. From tank prior to bottling, it was a rich, custardy, vibrant wine that I would have rated in the low 90s. Tasted blind after bottling, I've not yet found that same level of quality, but my ratings have climbed from low-mid 80s (back in the early part of this year) to high 80s now, as the wine seems to be regaining some of its rich, velvety texture to help balance its formidable acidity.

146438,US,"Gary Eberle brings his deft touch to Cabernet, resulting in this smooth wine with soft tannins and an elegant dryness. It's forward in plummy, blackberry fruit, with an earthy, coffee edge.

146439,New Zealand,"A brand-new wine from importer George Galey, this debut Sauvignon blends fruit from the Awatere and Wairau valleys under the watchful eye of Vavasour winemaker Glenn Thomas to make a mouthfilling wine loaded with gooseberry and pink grapefruit flavors.

146443,South Africa,"Not your average Shiraz, this has touches of tobacco, eraser and mineral to the rasberry and dark berry fruit aromas.

Imported by Cape Classics.",Zondernaam,88,20.0,Stellenbosch,,,,,,Shiraz,Tokara
146444,South Africa,"With big tannins and high acidity, this wine is explosive and fruity.

146445,Spain,"Starts out flowery and tropical, which is likely a reflection of the 20% Loureira in the wine.

A nice wine for those who like tropical fruit flavors.",O Rosal,88,19.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,,,,Albariño,Terras Gauda
146446,US,"Here's an old -style Cab. Tastes like it was picked earlier than most these days, giving a dry, rich earthiness along with acidity and firm, dry tannins.

146448,US,"This is a softer, fruitier Syrah than the Fortmiller, with somewhat better balance.

Just 2 barrels (48 cases) were made.",Sundown Vineyard,88,48.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Southern Oregon,,,,Syrah,Dobbes Family Estate
146449,South Africa,"Pinotage aromas of woodsmoke and sour cherry segue into Bordeaux scents of dried tobacco and cassis. This blend of 45% Pinotage with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot juxtaposes the former's vibrant fruit with structured tannin and brown leaf flavors.

146450,Italy,"Features rubbery red fruit and a lot of spunk. This is rosso in its freshest, most fruity form. Yet it's properly balanced by zesty acidity and noticeable but moderate tannins.

Will be good with food.",Casarsa Rosso,88,38.0,Tuscany,Colli della Toscana Centrale,,,,,Merlot,Villa Calcinaia
146453,Italy,"Nice and solid, but not quite up to the level of previous vintages. Maybe it was the heat of the year, but this Crognolo has more raisin and heft than its predecessors.

146457,South Africa,"Nearly black, this big wine smells like dark berries dipped in vanilla cream, with a hint of barnyard. The barnyard carries to the palate, where it's joined by leather and blackberry. Tannins start off smooth, but develop plenty of grip with time.

Best after 2010 and for years beyond.",Artist Collection,88,31.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,,,,Barbera,Imagery
146476,US,"The Merlot in Reininger's Helix line has flavors of toasty oak, and satiny red and black fruits. The blend, mostly Merlot, also includes 14% Cab Franc and 1% Cab Sauvignon. Substantial, slightly hot, with moderately rough tannins but a lot of flavor for the price.",,88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Merlot,Helix
146477,US,"The tart acidity of Sangiovese, along with its spicy cranberry, red currant and lean red berry flavors are buttressed with the addition of 27% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Syrah. It tastes very young despite its extended bottle age. Definitely a wine for acid lovers, it rounds out in the mouth with light flavors of hazelnut and mocha.",Tuttorosso,88,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Sangiovese,Brian Carter Cellars
146478,Italy,"Aromas of Golden Delicious apple, exotic fruit and kiwi seem very ripe and sweet—almost too much of a good thing. There's a saccharine quality to the mouthfeel too that is countered by a crisp close. This is a slightly aged Prosecco, so you should expect the bigger, bolder style. Imported by Vias Imports.",Dry,88,44.0,Veneto,Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze,,,,,Prosecco,Bisol
146479,Australia,"Has aromas of vanilla bean, apple, resin and light toast. On the palate, peach is the dominant flavor, coupled with an undercurrent of olive oil and a white-peppery edge. A little soft on the palate, but quite charming nonetheless. Imported by Southland Wines.",,88,16.0,Victoria,Pyrenees,,,,,Chardonnay,Blue Pyrenees

146482,US,"Substantial and authoritative, with the acid, backbone and structure to support the dense fruit. Happily, it is not smothered in chocolate. The wine unfolds in compact layers of blackberry, black cherry, light chocolate and a hint of tar.",,88,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tamarack Cellars
146483,US,"Well made, with a good mix of green apple and butterscotch, but less weight and density than some of the bigger wines. There's a bit of pineapple fruit also, hints of citrus and judicious use of the oak. The juicy fruit opens into light tropical flavors through the finish.",,88,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Chardonnay,Tamarack Cellars
146484,US,"Very pretty fruit, mostly from the young estate vineyard, sports flavors of fresh-squeezed grapes, plums and spicy cranberries. The oak is nicely applied, lending flavors of light cocoa and espresso bean to the well-balanced finish.",,88,38.0,Washington,Columbia Valley-Walla Walla Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Syrah,Va Piano
146485,Italy,"Small and fine perlage makes this a visually attractive apéritif choice, as do the soft floral aromas.

146486,US,"Good fruit and a great vineyard count for a lot, but these do not have the same concentration as Cabs from Champoux's old vines. The flavors here have the sweetness and lightness of younger vines, grapy and pleasant, but somewhat insubstantial. It's good, but not discernibly better than the regular Cab at less than half the price.",Champoux Vineyard,88,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Three Rivers
146487,US,"Dark and scented with cocoa, coffee, cherry and a dash of vanilla, this is a tannic, chewy Merlot. Hints of herb and a big splash of green tea-flavored tannins wrap it up; it's not what you would call a gentle wine. It should really be served with some red meat to cut through the tannins.",,88,19.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Merlot,Three Rivers
146488,US,"Spicy and brisk, this is a pleasing mix of crisp pear, melon and apple. The barrel time adds flavors of butter, toast and cinnamon, nicely melded. Particularly fine, stylish Chardonnay for the price.",,88,17.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Chardonnay,Three Rivers
146489,Italy,"Festive and less formal, this is a luminous sparkler with ripe melon, peach and toasted nutty notes that hits all the right marks. Nicely tart on the close with clean flavors and tight structure. The price tag is on target, too. Imported by Prestige Wine Imports Corp.",Arte Italiana,88,11.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,,,,,Sparkling Blend,Rotari
146490,US,"Sports an explosively fruity nose of berry and plum, with cloves and toasty oak in support. Medium-weight, with very nice fruit and good structure, it displays some engaging chocolate and spice notes. The finish is brisk and tangy, with bitter cocoa notes and firm, drying tannins. Hold until 2005.",Corley Reserve,91,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Monticello Vineyards
146491,US,"Absolutely opaque—it's definitely one of the darkest, inkiest wines out there. The black-currant nose shows lots of depth, with vanilla and cinnamon shadings. Though it is massive and a bit unpenetrable now, the softness, blackberry fruit and full tannins suggest it will be really nice in a few years. Just expect a real fruit ball.",Generations,91,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Raymond
146492,US,"This predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon blend could actually be Cain Four this year, as there's no Malbec in the blend. Large and taut, it displays tightly wrapped prune, toast, coffee and currant aromas. Possesses a handsome mouthfeel, with full tannins, tarry pine bark and a cocoa note on the palate and back end. An elegant bruiser, it needs three to four years to come around.",Cain Five,91,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Cain
146493,France,"This wine proclaims itself with forward and nicely integrated aromas of black currants, lavender and toasty oak. The wine displays a great deal of finesse, and the mouthfeel is velvety and rich, with dried cherry and anise flavors that extend through the spicy, long and even finish. A very impressive red with some tannins to lose, this is one Minervois that's capable—and worthy—of aging.",Cumulo Nimbus,91,35.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Minervois,,,,,Shiraz,Abbotts
146494,US,"Deep and sweet, but there's also an unusual and appetizing edge offered via cola nut and root beer. Any tartness to the blackberry fruit is offset by vanillin oak. Pleasurable, full-bodied and on the money. It's stylish good stuff with a correct amount of woody character.",,91,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,August Briggs
146495,US,"Some coffee and cola aromas add excitement to the otherwise black-fruit nose. The big cassis and plum flavors on the palate are rich enough to elicit tastes and textures of chocolate. A very pleasurable drink-me-now wine, with a fine bitterness to the finish.",Jack London Vyd,91,35.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
146496,US,"This Napa subappellation is a hotbed for large-bodied, tough-to-read mountain Cabs. Don't judge this wine so much by its tight, almost sauvage nose, but instead zero in on the fine toast on top of cassis and black plums. Deep and dark right until the very end, with soft but firm tannins.",Reserve,91,45.0,California,Napa,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fife
146497,US,"Very tight nose, with blackberry, coffee and cocoa notes, this is a big wine that shows great intensity and depth. Quite closed now, the dark profile keeps its cards close to the vest. One thing for sure: this is definitely one for the   cellar. The finish is lengthy, with brisk tannins as well as espresso and bitter-chocolate notes. Hold for eight to ten years; this wine should keep til 2020.",Reserve,91,120.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Mondavi
146498,US,"A tasty, toasty wine at a very fair price. It's a tad bulky, and it's packed with plum, cherry and coffee flavors. The mouth is nothing if not full, with some dry tannins adding necessary structure. Slightly one-dimensional and limited in scope, but what's here is oh so nice and friendly.",,91,32.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Titus
146499,US,"Black and burly, with notes of dill and horsehide. That it's opaque makes sense, given its heavy black-currant and coffee notes. Quite mammoth in proportions, maybe even bordering on syrupy.",,91,44.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Craig
146500,US,"Clean and nice upfront, with blackberry aromas and sweet vanilla. A lot of heft to the palate, and plenty of cassis flavor and tobacco nuance on the finish. Oak rears up on the finish. Needs some time.",Reserve,91,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rosenblum
146501,US,"Plum and kirsch aromas are offset by toast and coffee. Lots more plum, cedar, coffee and chocolate in the mouth. Tobacco and spice grace the finish of this well crafted, balanced and elegant wine. It's one that just feels and tastes right.",Select Reserve,91,66.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Per Sempre
146502,US,"The bouquet is dark and serious, with brooding black-cherry, leather and cedar aromas. In the mouth, flavors of black plums, mint-menthol and tobacco—all with a foresty accent—fill the palate. On the heavy side of medium-weight, with a supple texture, it has a long, toasty finish with fine tannins. Hold until 2004.",,91,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Caymus
146503,US,"Vanilla and cream, cocoa, and herbs really jazz up the medium-berry nose. Dark sweet fruit in the mouth, with some earth and cedar for substance. Bitter chocolate and espresso add backbone to the medium-length finish. Good and balanced, and not bad for current consumption.",,91,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chimney Rock
146504,US,"Cherry cough drops in a pleasant way on the nose, and then a medium-berry mouth, spice, light cedar and raspberries—there's a whole lot going on here. Not heavy on the complexity; rather it delivers clean fruit and simple spice.",Lauer Vineyard,91,39.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jessup Cellars
146505,US,"Typical of Swanson, there's noticeable toasty wood up front. Plums, currants and cranberry comprise the predominantly red-fruit palate. Finishes trim and precise, with fine-grained tannins and stylish oak. Wood-driven, but with plenty of other good things going for it.",,91,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Swanson
146506,US,"Very aromatic, showing a complex nose of cherry, spice, smoked and raw meat, and tobacco. The flavors are copious, too, with strong black cherry, licorice and tobacco elements. Balance and structure are beautiful here, and the coffee-chocolate finish has very good length, showing spice and blueberry accents. Lovely already, it will be better in four years and will drink well to 2010.",Elite,91,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
146507,US,"From a region not known for Cabernet comes a rich, tantalizing, luscious wine, with lots of cigar box/tobacco aromas and plenty of vibrant black fruit: currants and plums. Proper acidity drives the finish, leaving the mouth fairly refreshed. Has all the structure and balance one could ask for.",Harmonie,91,32.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Blackjack
146508,US,"Toast, mixed berries and some foresty mint make for an intriguing and inviting bouquet. High-grade currant and cherry fruit, with flashes of tobacco and mildly biting tannins. It's a heavyweight all the way, but one with balance and potential.",Oakville,91,45.0,California,Oakville,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Mondavi
146509,US,"Dark fruits, leather and game notes yield an almost Syrah-like nose that opens to chocolate, dark-berry and mineral flavors. Rich—even thick-textured—it is soft and quite approachable now, with fine, well-dispersed tannins. Finishes long, ultrablack, smooth and enjoyable. Drink now to 2007.",Synthesis Diamond Mtn. Vyd.,91,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Martin Ray
146510,US,"A complex bouquet with prune, earth, and some prominent gamy notes may put some tasters off, but the dark fruit and toast, and the generally restrained style make this commendable. A velvety mouthfeel and dense flavors on the finish close out this elegant example. Best after three years and good to 2008 and beyond.",,90,48.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos du Val
146511,US,"Bramble and cedar, along with plenty of toasty vanillin oak. Black currant is the dominant fruit; the mouthfeel is appropriately big, and the finish turns a bit dry, but with proper length. Very nice in the typical Napa mold.",Lupine Hill Vineyard,90,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frazier
146512,US,"The nose here offers a real mixed bag: some funk, a little perfume, worn leather, even pepperoni and peanuts. The mouth blends flavors of black fruit with peppery spice and herbs. It may be a touch linear and tight, but the basics are definitely there. Overall a very good wine.",Parks Vyd,90,37.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bartholomew Park
146513,US,"Taut but complex aromatics of black plum, chocolate, soy, and cedar open this very dark-hued contender. The oak here is lavish, and the wine appeals with its dark-cherry and toast flavors. Closes with a dry, evenly tannic finish. The insistent heavy toast makes it perhaps a bit of a one-noter, but it's a good example of this popular style.",Reserve,90,40.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Francis
146514,US,"Extremely dark, with toast, cherry liqueur and forest notes on the nose; this opens into deep black fruit, licorice and espresso flavors. The mouthfeel is full and rich, as it transitions effortlessly into a smooth, dry, anise and briar-tinged finish that has an interesting and elegant viscosity to it. A black beauty needing three to five years to develop.",Non Plus Ultra,90,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paoletti
146515,US,"Black-cherry and plum aromas on the nose open to similar flavors, with toast and mineral accents on the palate. An elegant and refined wine, with a lengthy finish that displays cassis and earth flavors, and moderate, even tannins. Not a heavy or fat wine, it shows very good balance and should be cellared for three to five years.",Reserve Beckstoffer IV Vineyar,90,41.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Guenoc
146516,US,"Napa Cabs are often described as being “curranty.” If you sniff and taste this you will know what curranty is. Hints of dill, cream, and vanilla support the cassis core. Quite positive and engaging. Structured and weighty, so it will probably show better in a few years.",Signature,90,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chappellet
146517,US,"Meaty and also jammy, with popcorn and cedar aromas. Dry and complex, typical of the winery's style, and mildly astringent. The tannins are starching at this point, but should fade. Given time, the red fruit should emerge and conquer the youthful astringency.",Estate Reserve,90,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Conn Valley
146518,US,"A brooding, intense nose of deep black fruits, violets and sweet leather opens to a full palate with fine fruit-to-acid balance. Black currant and earth flavors prevail, and the wine is more burly than plush. It closes with tart cherry and anise flavors. Good now, and better in two years; can drink to 2008.",Reserve,90,45.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Benziger
146519,US,"Full black-currant aromas with some briar and dust. Blackberry fruit on the palate, but most of all lots of charred oak manifested as coffee and bitter chocolate.

146522,New Zealand,"From a region of New Zealand better known for its Bordeaux varieties and gaining a growing reputation for Syrah, this Pinot delivers smoky, charred scents, meaty, plum and black cherry flavors and a finish that's surprisingly firm given the softness of the mouthfeel. Imported by Davies & Co.",High Country,87,30.0,Hawke's Bay,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Trinity Hill

Rita Hills,Central Coast,,,,Rosé,Sanford

146525,Australia,"Smells spicy and tropical, like something that you would want to drink on a beach vacation. The palate deals pineapple and coconut flavors, and good acidity.

146529,France,"The dosage level is 45g/l, which makes this wine a bit sweet, but not cloying. Toast and candied citron aromas and some honeyed apple and lemon flavors.

146536,US,"With one-third each of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot, this wine hits many high notes, including the delicate, elegant fruity-oaky balance, soft, rich tannins and just-right oak.

The flavors of dried cherries and cinnamon are subtle and enticing, while the tight, hard finish offers raisin and other baked fruits. Not complex but good in a finite way.",Sacravite,88,12.0,Southern Italy,Aglianico del Vulture,,,,,Aglianico,D'Angelo
146560,France,"A borad-shouldered and extracted wine, it also has some hard edges that demand cellaring. Herbal and cherry scents mix with darker, plummier notes on the nose, while the palate folds in earthy nuances. The one concern is that the alcohol level comes through a bit on the finish.",Les Reinages,88,34.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,,,,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Delas Frères
146561,US,"Young, full and forward, this delivers a big burst of nice, ripe fruit right off the top. It's cherries and chocolate, all good, but it loses some points for a gritty, tannic finish.",Two Vineyard- Old Vines,88,20.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,,,,Pinot Noir,Airlie
146562,France,"This lightly sweet VT goes down deceptively easily, blending ripe citrus and pear flavors with hints of clove and allspice.

146563,US,"A very unusual wine that most folks will either love or find off-putting. There were wildfires near the vineyard right at harvest, and the smoke from the fires can be smelled and tasted in the wine. That said, syrah is noted for its smoked bacon flavors, and this wine has them in abundance, along with some rich, plummy fruit.",,88,18.0,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Oregon Other,,,,Syrah,Jezebel

146565,France,"Not that effusive on the nose, but the flavors sing on the palate, revealing black cherry, earth and coffee flavors carried along on a supple, velvety mouthfeel.

146567,US,"Comes down firmly on the steely, cool-climate side, with high acidity and flavors of apples and citrus fruits.

146571,France,"For lovers of Syrah, Cornas is the purest expression, with its dark, brooding tannins and heady fruit.

146572,Italy,"Kind of big up front, with creamy oak aromas along with smoky notes of molasses and barbecue. Thick and fruity on the palate, with milk chocolate draping raspberry and cherry fruit.

146573,Italy,"Floral, with aromas of pollen and scented candle wax. Tight and structured, with a very nice mouthfeel.

146575,Chile,"Way beyond satisfactory, with smoky leather to go with the red fruit and oak aromas.

146576,US,"A new project from Gus Janeway, showcasing his careful and detailed touch with Rogue valley grapes. The blend is 30% malbec, 30% cabernet sauvignon, 21% merlot, 12% cab franc and 7% syrah, but rather than being a smorgasbord it is a focused, complex and layered wine that all knits together.

Try with duck with a fruity, gingery sauce.",Damiano Vineyards,88,20.0,California,Placer County,Sierra Foothills,,,,Viognier,Lambert Bridge
146579,Chile,"In the global Cabernet market, this stylish wine scores well. Aromas of coffee, mocha and oak support plum and cassis.

146581,Italy,"A fine trattoria-type white, best matched to light seafood antipasto or served alone as an apéritif. Aromas of clover-blossom honey and almond paste give way to flavors of unripe honeydew melons and tart limes.",,83,8.0,Tuscany,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,,,,,Vernaccia,Coli
146582,Italy,"The wine's structure has all the requisite parts and then some. It has good weight, crisp acidity and fine balance. Unfortunately, there's little fruit for it to support, and therein lies the problem.",,83,12.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,,,,Pinot Bianco,Tieffenbrunner

146584,Australia,"This is, perhaps, one of the strangest wines I have ever tasted. The aromas are of the sea—brine and seaweed—over a smidge of blackberry fruit. Ditto the palate. Medium-bodied, not too tannic, and ends with a black peppery note that evens out once the wine sits for a few minutes. Bizarre.",,82,19.0,South Australia,Riverland,,,,,Petit Verdot,Ellen Landing
146585,Italy,"Green grassy aromas with a sharper herb or chemical note open this round, soft wine. With its melony flavors and feel, it's a simple, slightly sweet wine with a hay note on the back end.",,82,11.0,Veneto,Veneto,,,,,Pinot Grigio,Coccinella
146586,Australia,"Distinctly uncharacteristic, this Sauvignon Blanc shows pear, banana and vanilla aromas. There's some soft tropical fruit with hints of butter, pear and apple, but as with so many Australian Sauvignon Blancs, not enough of an acid spine to keep it lively.",,82,13.0,Victoria,Victoria,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Taltarni
146587,Australia,"Cream and blackberry fruit dominates this Cab's nose; on the palate, the cream explodes into a heavy oakiness that masks the ripe fruit, and even turns it a bit tart.

146589,Australia,"There's a smooth quality to the wood, berry and caramel notes on the nose of this wine, but overall it's mostly about wood, as only faint fruit hints still show. Quite mature, it feels old and somewhat tired, albeit elegantly so.",,82,22.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,,,,Merlot,Heggies Vineyard
146590,Australia,"Lemony and zingy are buzzwords for this bouquet—expect the same citrusy tang on the palate as well. Mouthfeel, given the high acidity and citrusy notes, is best described as clean.

146594,Italy,"Atypical for this normally delicate varietal, hereÕs a big, sturdy wine with aromas of black raspberries, licorice, and plums, and the fruity flavors are big and full-bodied, although those Pinot Noir silky tannins are here.

146596,Australia,"This Chard's nose has pleasing butterscotch and cream aromas (that were somehow light enough to almost smell like a Sauvignon Blanc); sadly, the rest of the wine couldn't live up to the promising bouquet.

146601,Australia,"A prickly cactus of a wine that may yet blossom, given enough time. Piney, resinous notes on the nose, along with aromas reminiscent of scrambled eggs. Then the attack is sweet—almost cloying—before a strong sour-lemon flavor takes over on the finish. Bury this in your cellar for 10 years in the hopes that it will improve as dramatically as many other Hunter Valley Sémillons.",,81,13.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,,,,Sémillon,Margan

146603,Italy,"Falanghina and Greco di Tufo comprise the mix in this wine. It comes from Molise, an area described by some as the appendix of the Abruzzi.

This is confirmed by the predominantly caramel flavors and the mouthwatering acid levels.",Biblos,81,11.0,Southern Italy,Molise,,,,,White Blend,Di Majo Norante
146604,Australia,"This wine's eclectic nose of cotton, butter—and, as one reviewer thought, tinned asparagus—will please few wine enthusiasts. Palate is high in acid and minerally, with tinges of citrus and cream. Add to the mix a tangy finish of fresh wood, light honey and a green-apple Jolly Rancher. An enigma.",,80,10.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,,,,White Blend,Nirvana

146611,US,"This is a full-bodied Merlot, dark and fairly tannic, with young acids undergirding flavors of currants, black cherries and dark bitter chocolate.

146615,US,"A very nice example of this experimental variety in California. It's very dry, with an enticing dustiness that carries subtle flavors of cherries.

146616,Spain,"Broad and rubbery, with ripe black fruit and citrus peel on the nose. Good on the tongue, with a solid mouthfeel.

146618,Spain,"Chunky and ripe, with more power and potency than precision or finesse. Which still means it's pleasant, warm and tasty.

146619,Spain,"Looks good in the glass, and smells pretty nice despite a hint of barnyard. In addition, there's cola, vanilla and plum to consider.

146627,Spain,"Leathery and maturing, as the fruit seems to be on the fade. Dry cherry and raspberry notes carry the aging palate, which is bolstered by ample vanilla.

146632,US,"There isn't much Sangio in Washington, but the Pepper Bridge fruit is the pick of the litter. Ripe and nicely colored, this is 100% Sangiovese and actually shows some hints of pepper, tobacco and tea leaf.

146634,US,"Not to be confused with the Walla Walla Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon blend called Rediviva of the Stones. This wine is made from Champoux Cab and Boushey Syrah, rather than all Cailloux, as with its sibling.  It's a good effort, well made, but the component parts seem to leave a hole in the mid-palate.

146638,Spain,"A bit of brett and barnyard on the nose, with minty raspberry coming on to take over. A little leafy on the midpalate, but not what you'd call green.

It's superripe in cherry, blackberry and cassis flavors, and Grenache-like in the mouth, which means it's a little heavy for a Pinot. If you like this style, you'll love this wine, which came from a vineyard in the county seat, Santa Rosa.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,87,58.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,,,,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
146648,Spain,"The label says the Barker is big, loud and Spanish, and it's right. This wine is a racy, ripe, lively Garnacha with weight, flavor and balance. Tastes good, with cherry, plum, coffee and chocolate all stepping up and taking a bow. Ripe and ready at 14.5%, but on the money.",The Barker,87,9.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,,,,Garnacha,Sideshow
146649,US,"This is a good effort for the price, showing spicy cherry and raspberry fruit, light hints of herb, beet root and moist earth. It seems to get a bit earthier as it weaves into the finish, but it's well balanced and certainly well matched to salmon, swordfish or poultry dishes.",,87,19.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,,,,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley Vineyards
146650,US,"The tannins star here. They're Tony Soprano to everyone else's supporting role, including the delicious cherry and blackberry flavors and sumptuous oak. It's all very good, but “voluptuous” is not a word to describe this wine. Drink over the next three years.",,87,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Duckhorn
146651,Italy,"Big and clumsy upon opening, as nutty, earthy aromas dominate the fruit. Airing reveals lively black cherry and snappy plum flavors, but also a distant taste of sugar beet. Brightly acidic and almost tangy; it's obviously a good wine but it has a short zestiness that brings it down a notch.",Montepergoli,87,65.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri,,,,,Sangiovese,Enrico Santini
146652,South Africa,"Pinotage is known to be long lived, and this 6-year-old still seems young. Smoky aromas of roasted salsa, dark berry and brown leaf are forceful, while the cherry/berry flavors are plenty fruity, mixed with tobacco, mineral and smoke. Good tannin and acidity are tinged with sweetness, but the finish is smoky and dry.",,87,20.0,Stellenbosch,,,,,,Pinotage,Grangehurst
146653,South Africa,"Medium-bodied and nice in the mouth, displaying flavors of pineapple, apricot and sweet oak. The oak offers a toasty nose coating Macintosh apple, as well as a spicy, vanilla-laden and lengthy finish.",,87,17.0,Stellenbosch,,,,,,Chardonnay,Kanu
146654,Spain,"Pale yellow in color, with elegant aromas and flavors. To call it light would not be wrong: The wine shows grassy citrus notes but it peters out a bit on the back palate and finish. More subtle and fresh than powerful.",Orballo,87,19.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,,,,Albariño,La Val
146655,South Africa,"A very smooth, dry wine with tight acidity and a hint of alcohol to the palate. Aromas of dark fruits are a bit roasted, while plum and blueberry flavors are tinged with leather bordering on Band-Aid. Finishes warm, with vanilla accents. Imported by Cape Classics.",,87,69.0,Western Cape,,,,,,Shiraz,Mulderbosch
146656,US,"This outstanding vineyard was extensively re-planted a few years ago due to phylloxera, so these young vines are just in their second or third leaf. Good fruit, to be sure, but simple and light; this is not to be confused with the old-vine Shea, which has extraordinary power and dense, blackberry fruit. Here it's light cherry and berry, nothing more.",Shea Vineyard,87,75.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,,,,Pinot Noir,Torii Mor
146657,US,"Yes, that is the correct price. This Applegate Valley Zin might be considered the Turley of Oregon. The bottle alone must weigh several pounds. Concentrated raspberry and boysenberry fruit retains enough acid to keep it from becoming syrupy. The  supremely oaky flavors carry streaks of Kahlua and dark chocolate. But the density that might balance the 16.5% percent alcohol just isn't there.",Estate Reserve,87,100.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Southern Oregon,,,,Zinfandel,Troon
146658,Spain,"A masculine, rubbery nose covered with oak and dark-fruit aromas is stage one. Next up comes a spicy, solid palate that has some tannin and complexity to go with dry berry flavors. Not uncommon or unusual. It's got the goods, so to speak.",Doce Meses,87,15.0,Northern Spain,Vino Tierra de León,,,,,Prieto Picudo,Villacezan
146659,US,"Stiff and hard, it has green, leafy flavors and tough, tight tannins. This is the type of Oregon Pinot that needs breathing time, decanting, and perhaps a few years in the cellar.",Estate,87,28.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,,,,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley Vineyards
146660,South Africa,"A mild nose of dark berries and violets uncovers grilled meat, mineral, and finely oaked berry fruits. The structure is tightly wound, acidity wrapping tannins in a silky feel.

146661,Spain,"Clean and pure to the nose, with lemon and other sheer citrus fruit aromas. Gets plump in the mouth, but not fat, with melon and orange-driven flavors. Good, full, mouthfilling and solid. Shows nothing out of the ordinary.",,87,17.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,,,,Albariño,Castel de Bouza
146662,US,"Bracing and tart, with mixed citrus flavors suggesting lime, lemon and a trace of pineapple.

146663,US,"Here's a really ripe Cab that bursts with cherry, black currant, coffee and cocoa flavors wrapped in smooth tannins. It's a little obvious, but has some real complexity.

146665,Spain,"Lemony gold in color, with mineral-infused apple as the lead aroma. Maybe a bit bigger than average, with some roundness and chunkiness to the palate.

146666,South Africa,"Nail polish aromas blow off to reveal white fruit, but in the mouth there is no missing the depth of gooseberry and pineapple flavors that abound.

146667,US,Shows lots of rich varietal character and classy tannins that frame cassis and mocha flavors  that finish dry.

146668,New Zealand,"New Zealand Sauvignons near the $10 mark that aren't being churned out by a huge multinational corporation are getting hard to find, but here's one example, and it's available in magnums too, which should be even more economical—provided you've got a big enough thirst or enough guests to down all that wine. This excellent value in NZ SB is a bit understated on the nose, but still offers herbal flourishes, stone fruit and citrus in a medium-bodied, well-rounded package. Picks up refreshing passion fruit notes on the finish.",,87,11.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Redcliffe

146674,Hungary,"With 70% Hárslevelû, this single-vineyard bottling changes the usual formula for Tokaji, normally Furmint heavy. Amber-colored and showing some oxidation, it offers floral aromas and dried apricot, some earthy notes and a bit of volatility.

146675,Argentina,"For some time now this wine has been the measuring stick for Argentine Viognier, and the '05 vintage is one of the best yet.

146677,US,"From Nicholas Cole Cellars, this Merlot (74%), Cab Franc (15%), Cabernet Sauvignon (11%) blend is sourced from Klipsun, Champoux, Seven Hills and DuBrul vineyards. That's great fruit. It's a plummy wine with a raisiny edge that hints at early oxidation, and it's already showing some brick orange at the rim. Soft to the point of being a bit soapy in the mouth, it continues with mature flavors of black cherry, cola, molasses and chocolate.

146678,Australia,"With just 4% Viognier, for better or worse it doesn't have that  lifted-aroma quality that Viognier usually lends these kinds of blends.

146684,US,"Boudreaux has set a consistent house style in place, and it is best described as extremely smooth, chocolaty and soft.

146688,US,"Dark, smoky and chewy, this young, tannic effort could stand in for any good Walla Walla Syrah from a dozen different producers. It is a testament to the quality of Washington Syrah; but also an example of the sameness that plagues many of them.

146692,US,"Puget Sound is the smallest and least-well-known appellation in Washington State, but among the dozen or so wineries that actually grow grapes here, Whidbey is the standout. Their Siegerrebe (a relative of Gewürztraminer) is an off-dry white wine, rich with citrus, spice, honey, pear, apricot and pine tar.

146701,US,"Heavily oaked, with peanut aromas masking the fruit. But in the mouth it has more accessible fruit—mostly cassis—and once again the full allotment of wood.

Will the fruit emerge?",Reserve,90,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Whitehall Lane
146702,US,"At the bottom end of our range, this stalwart is tightly wound and fairly driven. Plum and cassis on the palate offer just the slightest nuance of cured Italian meat.

146703,US,"Impressive and elegant, this one leans American with its R & B name and packaging, but is rather French in profile. The black-cherry fruit is offset by a lead-pencil element reminiscent of some top Bordeaux chateaus. Angular and fairly crisp, it shows coffee accents and a fairly long finish.

146716,US,"Luscious aromas of dark cherry, raspberries and vanilla, with pungent spice and even bacon notes, mark the nose of this attractive and well-balanced wine.

146720,US,"One of the few wines from this cooler Sonoma appellation in our tasting, and a nice one indeed. The aromas differ from the norm; there's spearmint, licorice gumdrops, herbs and tobacco.

146726,US,"“Swan Song” indicates that this is the last vintage of Cabernet to be produced from this vineyard block. So enjoy it while it's here: There's plenty of dry black cherry, licorice, cola and smoked meat, and dusty tannins with nice grip close the show. Our critique is that this is an excellent finalé.",Sarah Block Swan Song Reserve,90,39.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Murphy-Goode
146727,US,"Black fruit with a touch of prune and meat on the nose. Oak-lashed plums and currants in the mouth taste a bit burnt from the wood treatment. A woody express train, with lots of coffee.

146728,US,"A mix of Cabernet, Cab Franc and Syrah, this out-of-the-ordinary blend is a little funky and meaty, but still offers lots of juicy black fruit and a whole lot of toasted oak.

146729,US,"Thunder Mountain wines often display a lot of character and evoke strong responses from our tasters. This ultradark Cabernet is no exception, with its overt heavy toast and black-olive aromas and flavors, heavy extraction, and full, but somewhat astringent, mouthfeel.

Needs five to seven years.",Bates Ranch,89,48.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Thunder Mountain

146739,Australia,"Smells very nice. The wine deals vanilla bean, nutmeg, musk and floral notes. This isn't a Chardonnay for the tropically inclined.

146745,US,"This high-altitude vineyard, way above Sonoma Valley, is often the source of tannic, ageworthy reds. In this warm vintage, the grapes grew very ripe, almost raisined, and the wine is soft.

146760,Germany,"This 14-acre monopole is Dr. B-W's top property. The wine has big fruit, but is still tight, with interlaced layers of pineapple, lime and mineral with a waxy note.

146763,Italy,"From the cherry, violet and tobacco nose through the full-flavored palate, this wine hits the right notes.

146766,Germany,"Simply gorgeous aromas of honey, apricots and tangerines are echoed on the palate, where the wine is full, rich and sweet without seeming overly heavy. The moderate levels of acidity provide adequate balance now, but may prove too low for extended aging; that's okay, because it's so good now.

146768,Germany,"Yes, this is the current release. The “R” series of Dr. B-W has a minimum of 5 years in bottle; in this case it's 10. The concentrated and intense superripe aromas and flavors are not too sweet, show no botrytis and are still quite lively at this age. Tropical fruit, orange and pure grape flavors mingle sensuously with spice and vanilla. They play out on a long, ripe, almost unctuous finish that blends in hints of diesel.

146771,US,"This firmly structured wine has a core of plum and black-cherry fruit enveloped in toasty oak. It's decidedly dry, and the full tannins may make it seem austere—it's rather Rhône-like for a California Syrah.

146774,Germany,"A sinuous wine with lots of lime and mineral elements beautifully entwined. The bouquet is attractive but taut with lime and mineral notes. In the mouth the wine really opens up, with peach, tangerine, lime and green-apple fruit with a faintly spritzy feel. The sweet fruit is supported by good acidity and balanced nicely by the strong, stony mineral element. The fruit, minerals and good grip, must come from the amazingly steep rocky vineyard source.

146779,US,"Big, rich and extracted, this wine was partially barrel fermented, and there's quite a bit of sweet, smoky, vanilla-tinged oak—from the aromas through the long, spicy finish.

146782,Germany,"The soft, spicy scents of the bouquet mix grapes, flowers, talcum powder and a faint petrol note to create an almost Gewürz-like symphony. It's lovely and impressively complex, as layers of grape flavor, flowers, minerals and citrus rind gain power in the mouth. The mineral elements come up on the tangy finish.

146786,US,"This impressive Paso Robles Bordeaux blend is a plush, opulent wine. The fruit is ripe and sweet, the tannins fine, and it has balance and harmony.

146787,Germany,"This is a big, slatey, mouthfilling Saar wine, bone dry, with depth and dimension, the kind of wine one can savor with or without food.

146794,US,"A high test version at 15% alcohol, this successfully skirts the problems that can plague such wines.

146798,Chile,"Alvaro Espinoza, owner of this label, has thrown a lot of hot, spicy oak at this tannic heavyweight, and it may need a few years to show its true identity.

It's fat, food friendly and ready to drink.",Les Oliviers,88,,Rhône Valley,Saint-Joseph,,,,,Marsanne,Ferraton Pere et Fils
146806,France,"A ripe, full-bodied Crozes, with herbal aromas, and great smoky, leathery flavors. Red fruits add to the mix, which also shows some barnyard characters which don't offend and certainly add complexity. This is a well-made, good value wine.

146807,France,"Scents of buttered popcorn lead the way, followed by waves of oak-derived flavors: cedar, vanilla and chocolate, backed up by some black cherry notes. The mouthfeel is supple and creamy, the finish moderately tannic. Drink this lavishly oaked wine from 2007-2015, once the wood has integrated a little better with its fruit substrate.",Vigne du Chanoine Trouillet,88,30.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Luberon,,,,,Red Blend,Château Val Joanis
146808,France,"Starts with smoky, leathery aromas, then moves on to scents of sun-baked stones. Mouthfilling dark, brandied cherries follow, finishing with a spike of acidity and firm tannins.

146810,Chile,"Highly aromatic, this explodes with bright passion fruit scents and herbal pungency. Lots of pink grapefruit flavor and a zesty, crisp finish make this eminently drinkable. Drink now, as an apéritif or with light appetizers.",,88,10.0,Casablanca Valley,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Veramonte
146811,Italy,"Dark and intense, with lemony oak on the nose that you can't miss. In the mouth, licorice, plum and pepper wrestle with some oakiness, but the whole is successful.

146812,US,"Chocolate-covered raisins here, real ripe and fruity, with smooth tannnis and a rich, creamy mouth feel. This is a big, brawny style of Cab, but it's lush and attractive.",,88,28.0,California,Calaveras County,Sierra Foothills,,,,Meritage,Newsome-Harlow
146813,US,"This Bordeaux blend, plus Zinfandel, is a fine example of how this appellation can produce rich, dry and balanced red wines of substance and harmony.

The Zin brings pepper and a feral quality.",Ventuno Anni,87,22.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Castoro Cellars
146814,France,"There is perfumed fruit, with aromas of red currants.

146816,Italy,"Good raisin and cherry aromas give way to chocolate and earth scents. Fairly snappy and lean in terms of fruit, but incredibly fresh and lively. Some bitter chocolate and coffee on the finish add character. Fine as an everyday offering.",,87,13.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,,,,Nero d'Avola,Abbazia Santa Anastasia
146817,Chile,"Nice on the nose, with subtle lavender, plum, chocolate and green-pepper notes. Extremely rich and creamy, maybe too much so; the palate is a heavyweight, with black plum, fudge and vanilla. Very soft and low-acid, almost like dessert. Has its qualities and faults.",Alka,87,55.0,Colchagua Valley,,,,,,Carmenère,J. & F. Lurton
146818,US,"This is a crisp, refreshing sipper that's long on fruity flavor. Bright acidity under girds the lemon and lime, grapefruit, peach and slightly grassy flavors, and the finish is spicy and clean.",Carol's Vineyard,87,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,J. Lohr
146819,France,"Huge, spicy wood dominates this powerful wine. It also has good acidity, which gives it a lift and liveliness.

146824,Spain,"Seems a touch green and stripped at first, but airing brings it around.

146832,Spain,"Meaty on the nose, with chunky leather aromas along with mature fruit. In the mouth, it's a touch racy and acidic, which serves to bolster its raspberry and pie-cherry personality. Pretty good overall, with a sizable allotment of zest.",Reserva,86,47.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,,,,Tempranillo,Altanza

146834,Bulgaria,"A very drinkable wine that could pass for a well-made cru bourgeois, this Cabernet was a nice surprise.

Drink now.",Reserve Unfiltered,86,15.0,Danube Hills Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kanov Vineyard
146835,Spain,"Lean on the bouquet; there's almost zero yeast or lees character. But there is an interesting smoked-meat aroma that conjures memories of sausage or ballpark franks. Aggressive in the mouth, with green herbs and paprika. An unusual cava with confusing characteristics.",Aniversario PA 84 Brut Nature,86,70.0,Catalonia,Cava,,,,,Sparkling Blend,Parxet
146836,Spain,"Quite aggressive and murky at first, with a gassy, heavy bouquet of leather, earth and cooked plums. A lot of dryness comes out on the palate, courtesy of starchy tannins and medium-weight red fruit. Finishes with grip, size and a heavy hand. For best results, give it as much time as you can.",Elite,86,55.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,,,,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
146837,Spain,"Saucy and mildly seductive, with aromas of herbs, leather and exotic spices. In the mouth, however, things seem a touch rustic and burnt.

146838,US,"This wine is quite dry, with a good grip of dusty tannins and a silky mouthfeel. It has cherry-berry and cocoa flavors and a long, fruity finish.

146840,France,"A small parcel of vines belonging to Château Peyrabon are in Pauillac and these are vinified separately as Fleur Peyrabon. This 2002 is piled with wood, dense tannins and dryness.

146848,Spain,"Riper and deeper than some in this class, but arguably overoaked and roasted, such that the finish tastes like burnt coffee and the bouquet smells of peeled tire rubber. In between look for plum, blackberry, cumin and black pepper.",Crianza,86,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,,,,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
146849,Spain,"This basic RdD delivers a smooth, ripe nose with doses of forest, bacon, road tar and violets, and there's some plum and blackberry at the foundation.

146850,Italy,"Full and penetrating aromas get it started, but beware of some horsehide and leather that some might term barnyard.

146851,US,"Tasting a bit raisiny from this warm, dry year, with gobs of sweet cherries and cocoa. Lush, rich, full, still fairly tannic at the age of 9-1/2 years, the wine should continue to develop for an additional five to ten years.",Rubicon,87,90.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Niebaum-Coppola
146852,Spain,"Ripe yet a bit chunky, probably a reflection of this estate's somewhat inland location. Shows sweet grapefruit and almond flavors, with a touch of pithy bitterness on the finish.

146854,US,"The grapes are from the estate in Yountville, just south of Oakville, and young Dominus always seems tight and austere. So it is here.

146856,South Africa,"The nose is a bit muddled, with earth and brown sugar, but the finish is long and fruity.

146858,Italy,"One sniff delivers berry aromas and a blast of maple, but alongside that there's some barnyard and funk. When you accept that it's Italian Syrah some of the herbal, funky qualities become more understandable; still, you have to be able to deal with the leather, spice, tannin and aggressiveness or it won't be your bag.",Il Bosco,87,49.0,Tuscany,Cortona,,,,,Syrah,Tenimenti Luigi D'Alessandro
146859,South Africa,"Passionfruit and mineral leap from the glass, while the flavors of honeydew, peach and a spritz of lime have good intensity.

146860,US,"Stiff and hard, with green, leafy flavors and tough, tight tannins.

146861,Germany,"This old-vine parcel of Erdener Prälat has yielded an impressively minerally and spicy spätlese, buffered by ripe apples and pears. A slightly oily texture suggests ample concentration, but the wine doesn't fully flesh out in the midpalate, leaving a slight hollowness that kept me from being more enthusiastic.",Erdener Prälat Spätlese Alte Reben,87,41.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,,,,Riesling,Schmitges
146862,US,"Most Rogue Valley Syrahs seem to have oppressively dry, heavy tannins, but here the grainy flavors are well-integrated into the mixed red fruits.

146863,South Africa,"Toasty vanilla meets peach, apricot, and honeysuckle in a classic Viognier nose. Round in the mouth, with moderate acidity, the melon and peach flavors are brushed aside by toasty, buttery oak.

Imported by Cape Classics.",Cape of Good Hope,87,20.0,Coastal Region,,,,,,Viognier,The Foundry
146864,Italy,"Nice and ripe, with sweet plum and black cherry on the open, well-padded nose. Full in the mouth, with satisfying cherry, plum and chocolate flavors.

146865,US,"What a nice job Beaulieu does every year with this wine, from their home territory. It's dry and polished, with loads of black currant, licorice and chocolate flavors.

146866,Spain,"A lower selection of grapes than the winery's superior Dona Rosa results in a fresh wine full of apple, nectarine and minerality. Not particularly complex but goes down nicely. Classic everyday Albariño.",Alba Rosa,87,15.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,,,,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
146867,Germany,"Intensely petrolly on the nose, with a rather full mouthfeel and dense, minerally flavors. This is stolid and sullen right now, but undeniably intense.

146870,South Africa,"A fairly big wine, with big tannins and high acidity, that lets its flavors do the talking. Lush purple fruit and coffee is streaked with lemon and mineral.

146871,New Zealand,"A step up in quality from the 2004, and a step down in price make this Pinot a hit any way you slice it. Black cherry and plum fruit is balanced by hints of menthol and vanilla from oak. It's on the full-bodied, muscular side and admittedly a bit chunky, but does show fine dusty tannins and decent length on the finish.",,87,13.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Oyster Bay
146872,Germany,"A bit of a disappointment after the stellar 2004 auslese, Vollrads's BA is thick and syrupy, but also has a slightly acetic edge to its aromas and flavors.

146873,South Africa,"A heavyweight, this Cabernet-Merlot blend tips the scales with full-on pruned berry flavors that are almost candied. Jammy, the big tannins are coated with a touch of sweetness.

146874,South Africa,"Vibrant red, with a spicy nose of pepper, graham cracker, mint, plum, and a hint of bramble. Full-bodied and big, with chalky tannins and high alcohol (15.5%), the loaded dark fruit flavors lean towards prune, with coffee and chocolate riding shotgun. The long finish is smooth, but the heat in this wine makes it near impossible to pair with food.",Peter Barlow,87,48.0,Stellenbosch,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rustenberg
146875,Spain,"Pineapple, melon and mineral on the nose are welcoming aromas. The mouth is nice, with citrus and melon flavors. Plenty of feel and body, and pleasantly wet, meaning it's fresh, properly acidic and refreshing.",,87,27.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,,,,Albariño,Pazo de Eiras
146876,New Zealand,"Winemaker Larry McKenna's Pinots tend to be more muscular and ageworthy than this example, perhaps the result of vintage conditions rather than any stylistic change. In any event, it's a pretty, lighter-styled wine, with cherry fruit flavors enhanced by chocolate, caramel and touches of celery seed and spice. Silky and delicate in the mouth, but the flavors fade a little too quickly on the finish.",,86,35.0,Martinborough,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Escarpment
146877,South Africa,"Flavors of white stone fruits, peach pit and spicy oak are a surprise after a modest nose of melon.

146878,US,"There may be a little oak on this Chard, but the fruit really stars. The apple, peach and apricot flavors are perked up by crisp acidity, and the alcohol is a refreshingly low 13%.

146895,US,"Made from Pinot Noir, this bubbly is quite dark in color, and those Pinot flavors of cherries, strawberries, cola and tea really star.

146896,US,"A very nice effort at this price, it's smooth and supple, with surprising chocolaty notes (surprising because the winemaker insists that no new oak was used). It's developing more quickly than Sheridan's higher-priced wines, but drinking very well right now, showing the forward, delicious, mixed fruit flavors of this extremely warm vintage.",Kamiakin Red,88,18.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Red Blend,Sheridan Vineyard
146897,Hungary,"Meaning “honey pot,” Mézes Mály is an esteemed south-facing, first-growth vineyard. This wine has an oxidized character resulting in nutty aromas and cheese-rind flavors. Still, this wine also showed flavors of dried apricot and raisin, although none of the namesake honey. Finishes long, but the oxidative note was still a strike against this wine.

146899,US,"Walter Dacon's three Syrahs are well made, but so very much alike it is hard to understand why they warrant three separate bottlings, at three different prices. The Magnifique takes us back to the French oak treatment, again pure Syrah, from a mix of Red Mountain, Horse Heaven Hills and Yakima Valley vineyards. Just 160 cases produced.",C'est Magnifique,88,38.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Syrah,Walter Dacon
146900,US,"Scents of cherry, crackers and milk chocolate lead pleasantly into a light, bright strawberry and cherry candy-flavored Sangiovese. Just a touch of spice adds life to the tannins, but it's the balance overall that makes this a standout.",,88,17.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Sangiovese,Whidbey Island Winery
146901,US,"The fruit comes from two great Yakima Valley vineyards, Boushey and Elerding, and although the alcohol pins the meter at 15.3% it holds together with pretty cherry fruit, plenty of acid and tannin to provide the backbone. 266 cases produced.",,88,18.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Sangiovese,Wineglass Cellars
146902,Italy,"A metodo classico, or bottle-fermented sparkler, with yellow fruit, rose petal and toasted-nutty notes.

146903,Italy,"Some fruit comes from the Canali family's original 17-acre Trentino vineyard that was first planted in 1893, while the rest is sourced from other vineyards in the region.

146906,US,"Though not as ripe or potent as the leading Boushey Vineyard Syrahs, this delicate wine is nicely balanced and reasonably complex, showing light pepper along with tart cherry- and berry-flavored fruit.

146908,US,"Whoa! 400,000 cases of this wine are being released, an enormous production for a Washington wine. Better yet, it's good. Smooth, plump and quite fruity, just soft enough (from partial malolactic fermentation), not too buttery, but just a hint of butterscotch. In short, it tastes like real wine, not microwave popcorn, and has some lasting power.",Two Vines,88,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Chardonnay,Columbia Crest
146909,Italy,"A Prosecco with personality and unique strong points: There's a toasty, bread-like element to the nose with generous peach, apricot, almond and crushed stone.

146910,US,"Dark berry, leather and herbaceous notes on the nose open to cherry, currant and tobacco flavors—it's all very much in the Bordeaux vein. The mouthfeel is similar: somewhat lean and angular but very flavorful, with an expansive cherry flavor on the spicy, long finish.

146912,France,"There's a funky, waxy edge to this wine that adds complexity to its honeyed melon, lime and pear aromas and flavors.

146913,US,"Cassis, blackberry and coffee aromas are 100% typical of Napa Cabernet.

146914,US,"A creamy drop of vanilla turns the red fruit this way and that; at one moment it's peppery and offers tastes of fennel, and then it is pure plums and cassis. Dry, dusty and earthy, this wine shows solid fundamentals. The early line is for a strong future.",Reserve,89,35.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dry Creek Vineyard
146915,US,"Fine berry fruit, dried flowers, and an olive note mark the intriguing nose of this very dry, even austerely elegant blend.

Hold until 2005.",Eloge,89,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Conn Valley
146916,US,"A big mouth-filling offering with lots of oak/cedar and coffee/mocha shadings. Sweet-and-sour stewed berry flavors and black-toast accents play on the fairly large-scaled palate. A tart chocolate note enters on the finish, which displays firm but fine tannins. It's the best Cabernet we've ever tasted from this Kosher winery, and it should improve over the next two to four years.",Special Edition Warnecke Vyd,89,42.0,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Herzog
146917,US,"Plummy aromas, black-cherry and oak, and accents of vanilla and cream. It's tight now, fairly begging for time to unfold. Presently the cherry core borders on tart. With time it should soften.",Founder's Estate,89,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,M. Trinchero
146918,US,"Easy-drinking, this is an example of a lighter, but still very satisfying style of Cabernet. The bouquet is tart berries, cedar, tobacco and rhubarb.

146919,US,"Blackberries and some funk in the nose: earth, leather, even a whiff of banana. Dark chocolate and an interesting citrus element add character to the standard berry fruit in the mouth. It's youthful juice, needing time to flesh itself out; now there's a lot of rambunctious black oak, which makes the wine seem a bit one-dimensional.",,89,50.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pine Ridge
146920,US,"A little reticent and cool at first; patient airing allows it to open up and display raspberry, cola and herbal aromatics, followed by spicy black-cherry fruit. It's a very clean, pure, proper wine that will competently grace most dinner tables.",,89,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Shafer
146921,US,"Rich, dense and cool, with an overt menthol streak. The fat, tangy fruit has a cedar edge and also a pronounced piercing quality. Round, voluminous, tannic and in general quite big. Now the wood is a bit heavy-handed. A year or two on its side should help it along.",Reserve,89,39.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Merryvale
146922,US,"A little prune, cherry and tobacco mix on the nose with some leafiness, creating a bouquet similar to Bordeaux.

146923,US,"Interesting aromatics of cumin, tree bark, chocolate and more on top of black fruit: cassis and plum, mostly. Oak and currants bring it home, with a fair share of toasted oak speaking up on the finish. Rich, plush and drinkable almost immediately.",,89,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Karl Lawrence
146924,US,"An unmistakable meatiness marks the nose, and then there's some Middle Eastern spices like cumin and coriander. Earthy and full of black-fruit flavor, with oak pouring in late.

146925,France,"Very firm and tight, with streaks of mineral and textures of earth. Unyielding and a bit over-sulfered, but it hints and depth and concentration.",Morgeot Premier Cru,89,48.0,Burgundy,Chassagne-Montrachet,,,,,Chardonnay,Louis Latour
146926,France,"Crisp, with grapefruit aromas and flavors, this is textbook Loire Sauvignon Blanc. A mild smoky, mineral note adds complexity, and the full fruit is clean and ripe, yet not at all sweet. Pulls it all off with lots of class and style. This is still the model the New Zealanders are using in their Sauvignon Blanc efforts.",Pouilly Fume,89,20.0,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,,,,White Blend,Domaine Denis Gaudry
146927,US,"The bouquet offers intensely jammy prune and black-currant fruit, with tobacco and vanilla shadings making an appearance.

146928,US,"Opens with bright, tart fruit displaying berry, cherry and rhubarb qualities. This north-country candidate has good scale and mouthfeel.

146929,US,"To say the least, it comes out guns blazing and oozing mountain character. Animal and barnyard, coffee and earth, even burnt toast and smoky bacon are all over this wine.

146930,US,"The full, grapey nose is vintage Cabernet, but it's not particularly complex. There's a little razor's edge to the cherry fruit, with herbal notes on the astringent finish. In a word, it's crisp and tight.",Los Chamizal Vyd,89,35.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mayo
146931,US,"Quite black, with an espresso-like streak from start to finish. The plum and earth aromas and flavors are wrapped in a high toast envelope here. So dark it's almost hard to read, and at times it seems a bit heavy; but in the end it is likable, with burnt sugar and crème brûlée on the finish.

146932,France,"The proverbial Burgundian barnyard is on display here. Horsehide and hay are detectable, but are by no means bad or overbearing. The palate is deep and very solid. It's more country-style than refined, which makes it well suited to casual drinking. Will benefit from a couple of years of bottle age.",,88,22.0,Burgundy,St.-Romain,,,,,Pinot Noir,Alain Gras
146933,US,"A rich dark-cherry- and blackberry-dominated wine, with lots of oak and vanilla accents on both the nose and palate.

Give it another year, then drink to 2010.",,88,33.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Burgess
146934,US,"Very black-fruited and equally heavy on the toasted oak, which together yield a menthol-and-mint aroma package. A bit of a love-it-or-leave-it wine, as its extreme oaking leaves the impression of espresso and char. The finish is on the short side, and the body a bit hollow given its gigantic proportions.",Estate Bottled,88,90.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Legacy
146935,US,"Packed in upfront, with some atypical grassy, wildflower aromas. Chunky fruit and Port-like flavors make a statement, as does a black-tea note on the finish.

146938,France,"A number of intense aromas and flavors make this Rhône-varietal white very appealing.

146941,US,"There's an orchard of fruit in this dry, smooth wine. The flavors range from blackberries and plums to cherries, with slightly bitter coffee notes. The tannins and acids stick out a bit now. Try holding until mid-2006.",,86,33.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Zahtila

146947,US,"It's awfully hard to make a really good Pinot Noir for less than, say, $30. This wine tries hard.

146948,US,"With fruit sourced from everywhere from Dry Creek to Carneros, this Cabernet-based wine is a good, blended effort, with true varietal character if no particular complexity.

146951,New Zealand,"Starts off with a lovely, complex mix of cola, caramel, cherries, vanilla and herbal notes, but seems a bit simpler on the palate, delivering cherry and vanilla flavors.

146962,Australia,"A wine that was a contest entry, hence its name. It's rich, but a little hollow; as one taster says, it tries too hard. Aromas are of grape jelly, nutmeg and wheat bread.

146966,US,"The west side of Paso Robles is the cooler side, and this Zin is crisper than Peachy Canyon's others. That makes it a better wine.

146972,Germany,"A full bouquet with tropical fruit, floral notes and vanilla accents opens this very friendly and lively Riesling.

147006,France,"A bit severe for present consumption, this is a lean, stony wine, enlivened by hints of green apple and lime.

147010,Italy,"A model of consistency is this New World-style wine, which delivers red licorice, fruit pie, raisin and clove on the nose.

147011,US,"Abacela remains the single most iconoclastic winery in the entire Northwest, pioneering unusual estate grown varietals in Oregon's oft-neglected mid-section, the Umpqua valley. And doing it well, in all respects. The grenache is a bruiser, extracted, sappy and tannic, well made for its size, though lacking the super sweet extract of the Australian versions.

147019,France,"With its dry, dusty mouthfeel and moderate tannins, this wine clearly calls for some cellaring, but the ingredients for a successful evolution are there: balanced measures of tannins, alcohol, fruit and acidity. Leather, dried frruit and chocolate notes lead the way, followed by ripe black cherries and a hint of anise on the finish.

147022,France,"From its aromas of black pepper and cured meats, this wine screams Syrah. Of course, it tastes like syrah too, yielding flavors of blackberries, black pepper and air-dried beef. A bit leaner and less generous on the palate than Guigal's Saint-Joseph, but still an impressive effort, with a firm  structure and modest tannins on the finish.

147025,France,"There's a lifted, herbal element to this wine's aromas of cherries and dusty earth, but it serves to add complexity, not detract from the fruit. In the mouth, the flavors include hints of pepper and meat alongside oodles of ripe cherries. It's all balanced and harmonious even if it's not a blockbuster. A fine effort from a difficult vintage.",,87,13.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône Villages,,,,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine de la Renjarde
147026,Chile,"Starts raw and rugged, with overt sawdust aromas, but settles down to show spicy red fruit, licorice, leather and earth.

147027,France,"Shows plenty of ripe apple and citrus fruit on the nose, then adds a bit of diesel fuel to the mix on the palate.

147028,Italy,"The prime red fruit here jolts your palate to attention. Even so, it's sweet and ripe at its center.

147036,France,"Already showing some bricking at the rim, this St.-Emilion from the owner of Château Pavie is altogether different from that storied wine.

147048,US,"Some of the Napa '01s are instantly drinkable. Not this one. It's power-packed with tannins that numb the palate into submission. Hard to like now, and difficult to tell where it's going.

147050,US,"After encountering this tannic wine, you're left wondering if the cellar will be kind to it. Probably, but it's not a slam-dunk.

147064,Germany,"Feinherb suggests a style part way between fruchtig and full-blown trocken, and this wine matches the description, finishing almost dry.

147065,Italy,"Upright, with notes of cinnamon candy on a nose dominated by bright red fruit.

147066,Italy,"Fruity, fun and fresh, this young 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot blend is flexible, accommodating and easy to drink.

147068,France,"Shows the torrid vintage character in its aromas of chocolate fudge and flavors of dark plum and chocolate, but doesn't go off into raisins or prunes.

It's a big, bulky, tannic wine that might improve over time.",Domaine de la Croix Jacquelet,86,22.0,Burgundy,Mercurey,,,,,Pinot Noir,Faiveley
147069,New Zealand,"Fairly aggressive on the nose, with pungently grassy aromas that lead into a fresh, citrusy palate. Light in body, there's a dusty chalkiness to the mouthfeel and a tart, zesty finish.",,86,19.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Clos Marguerite

147071,Germany,"From the Liebfrauenstift-Kirchenstück vineyard near Worms, Valckenberg's estate Riesling boasts smoky, minerally aromas and understated fruit this vintage.

147075,US,"This is certainly the best, ripest of Trefethen's current crop of Cabs, but its built along very different lines from more opulent wines further north along Highway 29. It's surprisingly tough, lean and angular for an '01, loaded with sharp-elbowed tannins, but it does seem to have the fruity stuffing for the cellar. Hold until at least 2008.",Reserve,86,80.0,California,Oak Knoll District,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trefethen
147076,Spain,"The gold color and heavy oak aromas indicate barrel fermentation, which for this reviewer is not the ideal way to produce Verdejo.

Very thick and woody; like being lost in the forest.",Fuente Elvira,86,22.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,,,,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
147077,Italy,"A lot of sawmill is present up front, but behind the loud oak there's plum, raisin and some herbal leafiness.

A bit gritty but will work with food.",Bellezza,86,30.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,,Sangiovese Grosso,Castello di Gabbiano
147078,Spain,"Fairly mineral on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas rounding out the bouquet. Quite fresh and crisp, yet a bit hollow in the midpalate and on the finish.

147079,South Africa,"Like many of Vergelegen's wines, this Sauvignon Blanc has aromas touched with green bean; in this case the aromas are of chalk, flint and lime.

147080,New Zealand,"A good value in Pinot Noir, Villa's entry-level bottling offers a subdued nose, but perks up on the palate, delivering vibrant, tart cherries backed by notes of mushroomy sous bois, cola and chocolate. Silky tannins provide plushness despite a narrow finish.",Private Bin,86,19.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Villa Maria
147081,Italy,"Blame it on the vintage, but this blend from an esteemed Bolgheri estate seems a little underripe and volatile, even if it's mostly balanced, upright and serious.

147082,Italy,"A lot of sulfur at first, and that creates a cloud over the nose. Underneath, however, there's quality black plum, berry and earth notes.

147084,Italy,"A blend of 60% Vermentino and 40% Sauvignon Blanc that runs heavy and ripe but not out of control.

147085,France,"The wines of Faiveley avoid the raisiny notes found in many 2003 red Burgundies. This wine shows plenty of ripe Pinot character—dark cherries. plums and chocolate—but also astringent tannins that give it a tough exterior.

147087,New Zealand,"The result of a difficult vintage, CB's 2004 Pinot Noir is an attractive, pretty wine.

147090,US,"Shows an unusually controlled approach to Barbera, with a balanced texture more like a fine Merlot.

147097,US,"Here is a ripe, full-flavored Cabernet that clocks in at a moderate 12.5% alcohol. The blend includes 10% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc. Surely a great strength of  cool-climate, Yakima Valley Cabernet is its ability to obtain ripe, naturally tart, mixed fruit flavors, and avoid joining the syrupy, jammy, hedonistic crowd. What's here are pure varietal flavors of blackberry and cassis, just lightly kissed with oak.",,88,16.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bonair
147098,US,"Aged in American oak, with mostly similar vineyard sources. The American oak, with more spice to the fruit, and less smoothness overall than the C'est Belle Bottling.

147103,US,"Here is a full-blown 15% bruiser. Chewy, tannic and rugged, from vines almost 40 years old. Thick and chalky, the fruit has plenty of blackberry and black cherry flavor, with a smoky streak and a hint of black tea in the slightly bitter tannins.

147120,US,"A proprietary blend that tends to a sweet caramel-cinnamon and baked-apple aromatic and flavor profile.

147122,Australia,"Dense, with plum-prune, coffee and chocolate aromas, this wine offers very ripe dark-fruit flavors accented by tobacco and cedar shadings.

147123,France,"From the Côte de Rouffach area, this is a wine that's eminently alive. Apricot, nectarine and mango comprise the all-fruit nose and palate. All in all, it's like a peachy parfait.

147238,US,"This blend of Syrah, Mourvedre, Carignane and Grenache, which comes from California's Cotes-du-Rhone in southern Monterey as it approaches Paso Robles, is soft, fruity and simple.

147274,Spain,"Good but a bit less concentrated and pure than most. There's a whiff of sulfur on the nose, and in the mouth the fruit is solid but basic.

147276,Italy,"Chunky, open aromas start it off, and the bouquet is likable if nothing special. Dense and grapy fruit carries the palate, surrounded by spiky tannins.

147277,Italy,"Deeply colored, with intense crude oil, black plum and tobacco aromas. The palate is chunky as can be, with dark plum, blackberry and char.

147288,New Zealand,"Light ruby in color, this wine doesn't appear to be terribly rich or concentrated. But it's a charming, soft little Pinot, intended to caress the palate rather than stun it.

Ends slightly woody, but should smooth out in another few months.",Home Block,85,25.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Wairau River
147289,Spain,"A black-colored, deeply extracted wine with charcoal, mint and burnt berry aromas. The palate is certainly ripe, as plum and berry flavors hit hard.

147292,US,"Seems slightly dry and raisiny, rather than showcasing the opulence of its Stags Leap terroir, but it still shows pleasant notes of cassis, cedar, tobacco and earth.

147324,Argentina,"Dry and bit herbal, with red-fruit aromas and a spot of green. The palate deals good red-berry flavor with accents of black pepper and vanilla.

147325,US,"A Yakima Valley Médoc, this Bordeaux-style blend is quite dry, just barely hinting at Cabernet's inherent earthiness. It finishes with the sort of drying tannins one expects to find in a well-made cru classé.",Composition Red Wine,87,19.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Whidbey Island Winery
147326,US,"From the estate vineyard, this bone-dry white wine shows very tart citrus flavors, with a lightly bitter pear skin edge.

147327,France,"Founded in 1902, this is the oldest cooperative in Alsace and now one of the largest.

147332,France,"This wine shows an effusive nose of cinnamon, red berries and banana. Tangy, with moderate to high acidity, and a light, but not insubstantial mouthfeel. The juicy red-fruit flavors are offset by a touch of complexity in the form of a mild tarry note. Finishes dry, with brisk tannins, and should improve over the next 12 to 18 months.",,86,14.0,Beaujolais,St.-Amour,,,,,Red Blend,Georges Duboeuf
147333,Australia,"This very fruity blend has some interesting and complex notes on the nose, with herb, chocolate and sweet spice elements.

147334,France,"Dark red fruits, tar and licorice mark the nose. The full red-fruit flavors are solid and the good acidity,  typical of Gamay-based wines, lets them show well.

147335,France,"A Merlot-Cabernet blend that starts out a little awkward and then really finds its legs. This is a perfect “beginner's” Bordeaux, in that it's fruity, clean and precise. The lack of complexity and high-end nuances doesn't hurt it at all. A little overoaked, but with airing out it tastes quite good. And it has the stuffing to match with hearty foods. Best Buy.",Bordeaux Rouge,86,10.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Marquis de Chasse
147336,US,"Has a compelling and complex nose offering pepper, cinnamon, and black cherry, with earthy accents. A medium-weight wine, it shows good balance and sweet-and-sour flavors. The buttered black-toast/popcorn element rides a bit heavy on the cherry fruit. Herzog is on the right track; a few years ago a wine of this quality bearing the Kosher label was inconceivable.",Special Reserve,86,32.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Herzog
147337,Australia,"This dark, rich, earthy wine is notable for its ultrasoft but pleasing tannins. The fruit veers toward plum and blackberry, but it's not superfruity—rather, it's more restrained, with notes of sun-dried tomatoes and herbs. It turns a little thin on the finish, although there's plenty of spice. Best Buy.",,86,8.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Shiraz,McPherson Wine Company
147338,US,"Aromas of red berries, cherries, cedar and herbs open this reserved offering. Lean and a bit astringent on the palate now, it offers some berry, pepper and chocolate notes on the palate. It never really opens up, and even thins a bit at the end. Regrettably, it fails to impress in this company.",,86,45.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jordan
147339,France,"Redolent with aromas of pears, strawberries and kirsch, this is a tasty, forward wine that's more charming than sturdy. Less concentrated than you might expect for the appellation, this should be drunk up quickly for its simply delicious fruit.",,86,12.0,Beaujolais,Morgon,,,,,Red Blend,Georges Duboeuf
147340,US,"A plummy and rich nose, but there's also some varnish to it, even some paint thinner. In the field of big, high-priced players, this one doesn't make the starting lineup. It's a tad too hollow, and while good enough, it seems short on dimension.",,86,60.0,California,Oakville,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Miner

147342,US,"Smells very earthy and funky, with a strong hit of green pepper. More bell pepper and some cracked black pepper appear on the palate, which features some currant, licorice and lots of oak. Bright acidity helps it along, but it just can't escape its vegetal core, which holds it back.",Estate Bottled,86,30.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Eberle
147343,France,"Fresh, tight and properly crisp, there’s nothing here to put it in the California-blowsy category. Stone-fruit aromas lead into peach and green-apple flavors. Not much depth, but plenty of refreshing fruit and palate-cleansing verve. Best Buy.",,86,11.0,Burgundy,St.-Véran,,,,,Chardonnay,Georges Duboeuf
147344,Australia,"Very fresh and accessible, with bright, fairly sweet fruit. The basic orange/pineapple aromas and flavors with slight mint and lemon accents keep this easy drinker right on target. Has good mouthfeel, and enough tang to keep it lively.",,86,9.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Chardonnay,Stonehaven
147345,US,"This wine typically requires years to open up; now it's very tight and only offers a modicum of leather, toast and black-currant aromas. The plum and blackberry fruit is chunky, not stylish. The acids are bold, and the tannins are bulky, which masks what charm might be hidden beneath.",,86,35.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
147346,US,"Has a decent texture on the palate, but some difficult earthy, even horsey aromas are hard to get past.

147347,France,"Is it the lucid rosy color or the exotic flavor that invokes images of a well-made cup of tea? In this unusual rendering of the world's most idiosyncratic grape, it's both. Floral, light, even dainty, it tastes of strawberries, cream and a little woody spice. For an airy, light-bodied Pinot, this one scores points for expression. The finish is lovely.",Les Tonnelles,86,19.0,Alsace,Alsace,,,,,Pinot Noir,Dopff & Irion
147348,US,"Lean, with angular flavors of blackberry, cedar, beet, cinnamon, and a rhubarb-like note seen in only a few other wines.

Does not possess the depth or texture of the competition.",,86,45.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sullivan
147349,US,"This is a pleasant red with red-berry, herb and tobacco aromas. It sports an easy mouthfeel, with tart cherry, plum and mild tobacco flavors.

147351,US,Positive tea and raspberry aromas and flavors are partially offset by some root-beer character and an almost chemical quality to the nose that keeps this wine from ever getting out and running with the rest of the pack.

147354,US,"Owner/winemaker Milan Maximovich does not make wine by the book—so sometimes his offerings are a little strange. This bottling opens with big-time toasted oak (some might say it smells burnt). The fruit is unlike most Cabernet: It tastes like a hybrid of pie cherries and beets.

147356,France,From a warm area of France—the hefty body and overt sweetness virtually announce “Pays d'Oc white.” Melon and lemon notes spread across the chewy palate.

147357,US,"Light- to medium-weight, this wine offers a red-berry and rhubarb nose, with fine lavender accents. But it doesn't open into anything solid enough for us to get into.

147358,Australia,"The '97 version of this old-vines classic is earthy upfront, and packed with spicy plum and chocolate. It's a full-volume wine, with lots of style.

147359,Australia,"Expressive and solid; a pleasure to drink. It starts with complex aromas of pepper and boot leather mixed with flowers and berries.

147360,US,"A big, dark wine, with deep flavors of red and black stone fruits, and wild blackberries. Despite the size, it's a simple wine, easy to understand—it's a ribs-and-barbecued-chicken wine.

147366,US,"This flavorful, appetizing wine would be perfect with a wide variety of foods because it's so fruity and clean.

147499,Australia,"Has flavors of blackberry and grape. At this stage of its young life, this Shiraz is dominated by a veneer of oak, and seems flat, rather than vibrant, because of it. A year or two in bottle may yield a plumper, rounder wine.",,87,25.0,Victoria,Nagambie Lakes,,,,,Shiraz,Tahbilk
147500,US,"So much richer than the '03, and a really nice example of Edna Valley terroir. The wine is brilliant in acidity, giving it an uplifted, bright mouthfeel. The flavors of kiwi, tangerine and smoky oak are delicious.",Oliver's Vineyard,87,22.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Talley
147501,US,"Along with the Merlot there is about 15% Cabernet Sauvignon/Cabernet Franc. Good, grapy and dark; this is a broad, sturdy and ripe wine, which sails through the palate on a wide swath of black cherry fruit. It's consistent with the rest of the Tamarack lineup; sweet, ripe fruit and plenty of barrel flavors, muscled together nicely.",,87,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Merlot,Tamarack Cellars

147503,US,"Slightly murky, with vague aromas hinting at green beans and slightly stewed vegetables. It is certainly not a boring wine — it's got unusual nuances of spicy clove, tart cranberry, sliced orange and mixed citrus. There is a bit more volatility than some tasters will enjoy, but also lots of chocolatey oak, hints of tobacco leaf, and thick, soft tannins.",,87,33.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Franc,Sheridan Vineyard

147511,Australia,"Impressive for sheer mass and the enormity of its fruits and spices, which makes it taste almost like fruitcake or a dry Port.

147512,US,"A pure, monstrous expression of Napa Chard, this vintage of Ovation exudes quality. Fragrances of acacia and lilac accent the rich, toasty nose. A no-holds-barred wine with huge amounts of pear and peach fruit, banana, coconut and vanilla. One of America's heftiest Chardonnays, it's pumped to the brim with buttery oak.

147513,Australia,"An intellectual's wine from Western Australia; this Bordeaux-modeled blend is named after an 18th-century French mathematician, and it's better than pie (get it?).

147514,New Zealand,"A distinctly Burgundian-style effort, with aromas of buttered and toasted hazelnuts backed by spiced pears.

World class.",,91,33.0,Kumeu,,,,,,Chardonnay,Kumeu River
147515,US,"Deep, rich and spicy, and with a vineyard-driven flavor that shouldn't be taken lightly (it's from the well-regarded Sleepy Hollow and Pisoni vineyards).

147521,Australia,"The Aussies like to mix and match their white grapes: Here it's Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, and Chardonnay in descending amounts, and with great results. Pleasant and floral-smelling, with just a whiff of enticing mint or grass. In the mouth, it's the all-out fruit-bowl approach, with lime and peach most vivid. Juicy, clean, acidic and fresh.

147531,Australia,"Not yet widely planted in Australia, but maybe it should be, judging from this beauty. Starts out with complex, oaky aromas of ripe peaches, cashew butter, wildflowers, spice and cream, and tastes opulent and plush. The dominant flavors are ripe tree fruits, like apricot and peach, but it's very dry and well balanced. There's something unusually creamy in the finish.",,90,18.0,Victoria,Goulburn Valley,,,,,Marsanne,Mitchelton
147532,US,"A show-off wine, with multiple layers of aromatic and flavor complexity. Starts with an herbal, mountain-style fragrance before turning soft and smooth in the mouth, with an undercurrent of beet root, blueberry and wood. An atypical wine; it's unquestionably ripe, and maybe a bit too big for itself.

Gets more interesting in the mouth, with lime-like acidity to give it definition, and plump guavas, mangos and pineapples that caress your palate.

147535,US,"Features complex aromas of wild berries, stewed tomato, spices, herbs, and rich earth.

147538,Australia,"A wine named after its vineyard, it's quite fragrant: orange rind, cassis and fresh blueberries. It seems to have a sun-driven quality, because it's really sweet at the core. With a tad more edge, it might be a great wine. Now, however, it's just a pleasant fruitball. Age it for a couple of years to see if currently hidden nuances emerge.",Mountain Blue,89,40.0,New South Wales,Mudgee,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,Rosemount
147539,US,"A powerful Pinot from a cool region. There's plenty of root beer, bacon, and cedar in the rustic, woody bouquet.

147540,US,"You notice this wine's unctuousness from the glycerine that stains the glass. The aromas are closed, suggesting dark stone fruits. In the mouth, tannins mask a core of berry fruit.

147552,US,"This is the kind of wine people call “cocktail”: very dry and a little tart, ultracrisp and clean, and with the lemon-and-lime flavors that are palate wake-up calls.

147583,Chile,"Dark and tight, with sturdy plum and berry aromas along with some minty oak in support. Plump and chunky on the palate, but stand up, with a finish that runs peppery. A touch raw and oaky, but still better than most Chilean Syrah.",,86,15.0,Colchagua Valley,,,,,,Syrah,Arboleda

147614,Spain,"If it seems dirty at first, time will reveal tobacco and leather aromas along with black plum and coffee. Seems more sour than you might expect, with pie cherry and rhubarb flavors.

147642,Italy,"Not a bad entry-level Tuscan red; it shows sweet bubble gum and LifeSaver aromas with just enough darkness to make it nice.

147651,US,"I can see the intention here, to create a statement, 100% Cab that defines Raymond's historic approach.

147677,US,"Purple and blue, it tastes of tart cherry and blueberry fruit. The tannins are stiffer than the winery's other reds, thicker and somewhat chalkier, and they seem a bit distanced from the soft, fruity mid-palate. Overall it's another consistent, ripe, fruity, good, solid effort.",,87,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Franc,Tamarack Cellars
147678,Italy,"Toasted almond notes rise above well-integrated fruit flavors like peach, pineapple and banana. This wine isn't so fleshy, but offers a nice palate-cleansing freshness instead. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Sortesele,87,14.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,,,,,Pinot Grigio,Santi
147679,US,"This is quite a rich wine, and although it can't quite overcome Petite Sirah's rustic character, it is a great example of the variety. Fully dry and full-bodied, with thick tannins, it's filled with blackberry, black cherry and mocha flavors, with a meaty edge.",Ripken Vineyard,87,18.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,,,,Petite Sirah,Sheldon
147680,US,"Smooth and creamy, this pure-blooded Sauvignon Blanc is as light and clean as a spring breeze. Nicely ripened to flavors of fig and grapefruit, it adds accent notes of lemon rind and fresh herb.",,87,7.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Snoqualmie
147681,US,"Half Merlot, half Cab (mostly Franc) this “everyday” wine has lighter fruit but still plenty of the toasty, smoky barrel flavors that the winery's higher-priced reds. In other words, it's a perfect barbeque wine.",MC2,87,10.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Red Blend,Three Rivers
147682,Italy,"A less intense extra dry Prosecco compared to others, but very floral with pleasant streaks of banana, melon, white stone and peach.

147686,US,"Although it's slightly rustic, with some sharpness, this is almost the perfect Zin for barbecue or something more prepared, like braised beef or pork ribs. It's a comfort-food red, dry and full-bodied, yet clean, with an honesty that comes from the terroir.",Terra d'Oro Home Vineyard,87,25.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,,,,Zinfandel,Montevina

147688,Spain,"Light and lean, with lively fruit aromas and flavors. Freshness is what this wine pushes, because there's not much weight or overt sweetness to it. Light apple, a touch of pear, and some lemon-lime is the most that you're going to get. Still, it works as a palate freshener. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Leopardi Brut Nature,87,18.0,Catalonia,Cava,,,,,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
147689,US,"This complements the winery's “Rosso” and “Red” blends; it's the Bordeaux blend in the trio. The color is a bit murky, and the flavors, though pleasant enough, have a certain murkiness also, mixing earth, toast, hazelnut, some indistinct red fruits and a finishing lick of raspberry preserves. It's a good, all-purpose quaffing wine, but doesn't quite conjure up Bordeaux.",Rouge,87,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Lone Canary
147690,US,"This stylish, opulent wine is marked by an array of ripe fruits, ranging from citrus through peach, apricot and mango, and is lavishly oaked, with a rich, creamy texture and lots of smoke and toast on the nose.",Private Reserve,89,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Beringer

147692,Australia,"Mint, blackberry and an appealing meaty note up front, and then a nice, juicy blackberry palate accented by hints of red plum. This one is totally on the money, with an uncompromised balance between zesty acidity and soft tannins. For certain it's a more versatile food-friendly wine than its big brothers, the Black Pepper and the Ebenezer. Best Buy.",,89,10.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,,,,Shiraz,Barossa Valley Estate
147693,New Zealand,"If you are turned off by heavily oaked Chards, this is one to consider. It's loaded with light tropical-fruit aromas and flavors, along with a nice hint of peach. It's a little lower in acidity and verve than the excellent '98, but it's solid, and blossoms in the glass. A very practical, easy-to-drink wine.",Unoaked,89,15.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Chardonnay,Kim Crawford
147694,Portugal,"There's plenty of oak here, evidenced by the dominant chocolate and vanilla aromas, but there's also good fruit backing it up. Raspberries and cranberries provide a welcome counterpoint to the oak and extend through the long finish.",Reserva,89,22.0,Douro,,,,,,Red Blend,Quinta do Crasto
147695,US,"An intriguing nose of pine needles, slight barnyard, and a hint of dill is layered over ripe black cherries. A dense, yet soft and seductive wine that should reward cellaring with even more complexities.",Hirsch Vineyard,88,46.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,,,,Pinot Noir,Siduri
147696,Australia,"There's bacon, smoke, some popcorn, even chocolate. Clear and fresh berry fruit is supported by straight-ahead oak. It all comes together in a chocolaty, slightly earthy package. Fun and good, if a bit short in the finish.",,88,18.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,,,,Shiraz,Riddoch Estate
147697,Australia,"From winemaker James Halliday comes this sharp, herbaceously-scented wine suggesting grapefruit, grass and hay, with an undercurrent of smoky oak. It's strongly flavored, with focused lemon-lime fruit and sharp acidity. This clean, refreshing wine demands food; goat cheese would be heaven.",,88,17.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Coldstream Hills
147698,Australia,"Blackberry and creamy vanilla aromas with cinnamon accents mark the nose of this very pleasant red. Displays good depth of fruit, licorice notes and well-integrated oak on the supple palate. Decent acidity keeps it from being cloying, and the wine finishes with good length. Best Buy.",,88,7.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Shiraz,Banrock Station
147699,US,"Right from the start it's a tad different. There's a light apple-skin color similar to Pinot Noir, and brambly, cedar-like aromatics. Just the opposite of a rich, jammy Zin, this is a cruiserweight with spice galore—it actually borders on being a bit too piquant and sharp. An untamed Zin with a lot going on.",,88,23.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,,,,Zinfandel,Tarius
147700,Australia,"A very dark, very ripe wine that impresses through its sheer size. It smells sweet, with cherry cola, white chocolate, and vanilla aromas, and that impression of sweetness carries over to the palate. Tastes very full-bodied and rich, like black-cherry jam. The tannins are soft and velvety.",Winemaker's Reserve,88,20.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,,,,Shiraz,Barwang
147701,New Zealand,"This one falls squarely into the white-grapefruit and lime category. Quite herbal, with an outright green streak in the midpalate. Good tropical-fruit core, and round. Easy to drink, not piercing, and a little metallic. There's a basil-oregano note to the finish.",,88,15.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Tohu
147702,Australia,"Plush and full best describe this offering from Australia's western coast. Starts with clove and licorice aromas, then tastes of the essence of berry fruit. It borders on jammy and syrupy, yet pulls back with some edginess. But not too much—it's creamy and thick, with soft oak and milk chocolate.",Omrah,88,18.0,Western Australia,Western Australia,,,,,Shiraz,Plantagenet
147703,Australia,"Shiraz wine is an appealing easy drinker. Spicy and sweet dark-fruit aromas and toasty oak open to a round, full mouthfeel. Blackberry flavors and leather notes hold the sweetness in check. Finishes nicely, and a little less jammy than the nose and palate. This is a totally accessible and very satisfying wine for current consumption.",Long Paddock,88,14.0,Victoria,Victoria,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,Redbank
147704,Australia,"A forward and dark-fruit nose with peppery accents and a dill-menthol note open this pleasing Shiraz. Medium and dark-berry flavors with leather and herb notes play into a pleasing dry and full finish, with even tannins. Continues to open in the glass, revealing more depth and nuance than first evidenced. Best Buy.",Gamekeeper's Reserve,88,10.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,,,,Rhône-style Red Blend,St Hallett
147705,US,"Has lots of lemon, peach and green-apple aromas, with a pungent earthiness. Fairly well-oaked, with pretty citrus flavors and a spicy, rich liveliness. Fun and easy to drink.",,88,26.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Testarossa
147706,US,"From a region not known for Chardonnay, this is toasty and pear-tinged. It's a tad heavy, almost honey-like and brooding. The oak is pronounced, but it frames the fruit. A wine of individuality and earthiness, but also atypical.",Stefani Vineyard,88,20.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Gallo of Sonoma
147707,Portugal,"Slight cherry fruit is hanging in, but the emphasis here is on mushrooms, damp earth and forest-floor elements. The attenuated, tart cherry fruit provides a nice counterpoint to the earthy components in this mature, ready-to-drink wine.",Reserva,87,46.0,Douro,,,,,,Red Blend,Casa Ferreirinha
147708,Portugal,"Subtle smoke shadings color the predominantly blackberry and chocolate aromas before yielding to plum and black-cherry fruit flavors.

147709,US,"Crystal-clear California Chardonnay, with its trademark pineapple, pear and citrus flavors offset by a hit of creamy oak and buttery notes. Toast and butterscotch marry with faint lemon flavors on the finish.",Sonoma Cask,87,13.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Sebastiani
147710,US,"Light and friendly aromas of green apple, pear, vanilla and slate. Apples and pear flavors are touched up by a slight nuttiness. Finishes a bit heavy, with oak and toast stepping on and over the fruit. Full acidity keeps it tight.",,87,21.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Trefethen
147711,New Zealand,"The characteristic Sauvignon pungency of grapefruits and gooseberries has been smoothed over by barrel fermentation, resulting in a creamy, vanilla overlay that glides easily across the palate. Bright acidity shines through on the finish.",Reserve,87,13.0,Hawke's Bay,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Mills Reef
147712,New Zealand,"Oaky at first sniff, with plenty of vanilla and cinnamon aromas over black currants. The atypically warm vintage has yielded a wine that lacks the herbaceous character of many New Zealand reds, yet still retains excellent acidity. Ripe fruit flavors are countered by lemony acids, resulting in a wine that shows a pleasant yin-yang character.",Matheson Vineyard,87,20.0,Hawke's Bay,,,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Matua Valley
147713,US,"Offers up complex apple, lemon peel, and even caramel aromas, along with some spicy vanilla. The apple flavors are accompanied by spicy, butterscotchy oak, although the flavors could be more concentrated. A friendly, likable wine.",,87,34.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Vine Cliff
147714,US,"A certain root or beet aroma mingles with notes of smoked meats, hard spices and cola. Cherry fruit is bolstered by a dark streak: licorice, coffee and earth. Good mouthfeel, good finish, well-made. Could improve with age.",Lavender Hill,87,33.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Pinot Noir,Flora Springs
147715,US,"Ripe tropical fruit, bananas, some heat still, and roughness from the barrel fermentation. It needs some time to smooth out, but it's a very consumer-friendly style of Chardonnay. Best Buy.",,87,12.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,,,,Chardonnay,Bonterra
147716,Australia,"Giant and grapey, just as you might expect. It's 100% forward, with plenty of overt cherry, coffee and chocolate character, but it's also limited in scope and lacks complexity. A good food wine that's not overblown with oak, even though it spent two years in barrels.",Classic Clare,87,28.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,,,,Shiraz,Leasingham
147717,Australia,"What a wonderful wine at this price! It's got an amazing amount of sweet, ripe berry fruit and spice in a package that's balanced, rich, and harmonious. It might lack the extra dimension of a great wine, but it pushes the envelope of what you can get at an everyday price. Best Buy.",,87,8.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,McPherson Wine Company
147718,New Zealand,"Smoke and toast dress up scents of black currants tinged with herbs. One taste and you know it comes from a cool-climate region (though Hawkes Bay is considered warm by NZ standards); the acids are prominent, but should allow the wine to age gracefully once it settles down. Now it's a raw blend of 70% Cab and 30% Merlot that needs rich or acidic foods to tame it.",,87,16.0,Hawke's Bay,,,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Matua Valley
147719,New Zealand,"A unique bouquet of honey and tangerines suggests that very ripe fruit went into this succulent wine. Subtle vanilla notes add a creamy feel, and it finishes with bright citrus flavors. This is a big, fruit-forward wine that should be drunk over the next year or two.",Roseland,87,20.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Chardonnay,Goldwater
147720,Germany,"A nicely complex nose of apple, lemon and herbs gives way to a dry, smooth mouth full of grape flavor. An even, if slightly thin mouthfeel and smooth finish wrap it up nicely. It strikes one that Riesling is the only variety--certainly the variety that most often--does taste like grapes, as opposed to other fruits.",Kabinett,84,13.0,Baden,,,,,,Riesling,Stich den Buben

147722,US,"This light delicate wine comes from warmer parts of Napa Valley, including Calistoga and Pope Valley. The aromas suggest lemons, limes and buttery smoke, and so do the flavors. It's also dry, crisp and a little tart. Not a whole lot of substance here, but it does have its cocktail-type charms, and a good price.",,84,13.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,St. Clement
147723,US,"Crushed almonds, earth and a trace of honey and citrus mark the aromas. Then it turns fruity in the mouth and a tad sweet. It's a nicely balanced, apéritif-style wine for a fair price.",,84,10.0,California,California,California Other,,,,Pinot Grigio,Napa Ridge
147724,US,"This is a good, well-made Cab that satisfies without being particularly exciting. It's average in the blackberry and earthy aromas, and in its very dry, blackberry flavors. Then, it snaps to a quick finish.",,84,17.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaulieu Vineyard
147725,Chile,"$11. Opens with a highly perfumed bouquet of lime, anise and a hint of paraffin. Delicate and fresh apple, lime and stone-fruit flavors follow. Off-beat and slightly lean, but has nice balance.",Estate Reserve,84,11.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Chardonnay,La Playa

147730,US,"Opens with aromas of peaches, butter cream, vanilla and caramel, then turns fruity and rich in the mouth.

147731,US,"This is one of those “generic” red wines that smells and tastes of berries, with an earthy streak and a kiss of oak.

147734,Chile,"The smoke and menthol-toast aromas from new oak run alongside grass and green hay. The fruit flavors are light, but tend toward black cherries. This may improve a bit once the dry woody tannins on the finish subside; try in six months with grilled steak.",Reserva,83,11.0,Rapel Valley,,,,,,Carmenère,Santa Rita
147735,US,"Begins with pretty but light aromas of peaches and cream and vanilla, and turns watery and citrusy in the mouth, with high acidity. Whistle-clean, it finishes with lemony notes.",,83,14.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,,,,Pinot Blanc,Saint Gregory
147736,US,"A little less than ripe, it's got hints of blackberries but really veers toward an earthy herbaceousness. There's a cut of greenness in the aroma, and in the flavors, too. Finishes a bit rough and thin.",,83,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Merlot,William Hill Estate
147737,France,"Pale salmon pink, this is a light, easy wine. Faint melon and herb aromas lead to an off-dry palate with sour-cherry and anise flavors. Nothing complicated here, but good enough balance to be refreshing.",White,82,8.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Vin de Pays d'Oc,,,,,Chardonnay,Fortant

147739,US,"It says “dry” on the label, but when sampled in a flight of dry rosés it tasted distinctly off-dry. Cotton-candy and strawberry aromas combine with a unique herbal note.

147740,Chile,"Green-apple and yeasty notes prevail in this organic, all-native-yeast Chardonnay.

Soft and smoothly textured, it turns slightly tangy on the back end.",Nativa,82,15.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Chardonnay,Carmen
147741,Germany,"This rather rustic wine in a round wide ""bock"" bottle has a round mouthfeel, simple and earthy aromas and flavors. But a ripe, fermenting-hay note begins on the nose, continues into the mid-palate where it becomes a musty mature element on the straightforward grape flavors. Still, it might work with sausages or other country fare.",Qualitätswein,82,12.0,Baden,,,,,,Riesling,Stich den Buben

147743,Chile,"The soft melon and white-peach nose has mint and grass accents but also a faint mustiness. In the mouth the mild lime and melon flavors display an odd, lemon candy-drop sweetness.

147836,Italy,"Maybe this producer of top-flight Brunello should stick to that; Angelini's value-priced blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Canaiolo has a strong green element; taken with the tomatoey fruit it doesn't add up to much.

I applaud the innovation, and the care given to its extra aging, but confess puzzlement as to what exactly this wine is intended to be.

147862,US,"As with the reserve, the house style is to make a soft, lightly buttery, very approachable wine. Nice light tropical fruit flavors are a blend of mango, pineapple and banana. There is nothing heavy-handed about the oak, it's nicely layered into the background.",,87,13.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Chardonnay,Bonair
147863,Italy,"A bigger, bolder style with rich toasted notes of almond, vanilla and stone fruit. Very clear, with a lean, fresh mouthfeel yet those strong toasted notes might not appeal to everyone. Imported by Panebianco.",,87,16.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,,,,,Pinot Grigio,Loredan Gasparini
147864,US,"I've long thought Cab Franc is a secret strength of the Foothills. This bottling is dry, balanced and complex, with a rich earthy, coffee streak to the cherry flavors.

147865,Australia,"Jam, bramble and clay aromas usher in fresh grape, blackberry and black pepper flavors. Medium bodied, closing with spicy purple fruit.

Imported by Cannon Wines Limited.",Brut Rosé,87,17.0,Burgundy,Crémant de Bourgogne,,,,,Champagne Blend,Léonce Bocquet
147869,US,"Terre Rouge's most expensive Syrah, a best barrel selection, fortunately avoids the raisiny overripeness of the other Syrahs, although it's still a very ripe wine. The flavors are of berries and fruits that have been cooked into a pie.

147870,New Zealand,"Soft and jam-packed with sweet and snappy strawberry and rhubarb aromas. The flavors are similar and are buffeted by a refreshing cool herbal streak.

147872,New Zealand,"A ripe, sweet, citrusy, New World white that tastes more like Sauvignon Blanc than any Riesling from the Mosel or Austria. Despite its varietal aloofness, there's clean and refreshing grapefruit and orange flavors and a weighty body. If you like blazing fruit, this is it; for something steely and minerally, look to Germany.",Private Bin,87,12.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Riesling,Villa Maria
147873,Australia,"The model all-market wine, with popularity that seems to have no boundaries. In this vintage, it delivers crushed berry and spicy anise aromatics, richness, mouthfeel and a tasty medium-length finish. A wine for the grill, a party, you name it—this Shiraz shows no faults. It's a crowd-pleaser deluxe. Best Buy.",Diamond Label,87,11.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Shiraz,Rosemount
147874,New Zealand,"Solid earthy aromas accented by bacon and vanilla presage round berry fruit favoring strawberry and cherry. Fairly full-bodied, in that it stands up in the glass like a Bordeaux. Not austere or overtly spicy; instead it is friendly and comes to life with breathing.",,87,24.0,Martinborough,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Palliser Estate
147875,Australia,"The elegant, spice-driven nose makes a positive initial impression, and the body and flavors do a decent job of sustaining it. It's a little light in the midpalate, but there are ample black-cherry flavors and smoky oak. An extremely competent wine from Len Evans, a figure in modern Australian wine lore. Best Buy.",,87,12.0,Victoria,King Valley,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Evans Wine Company
147876,Australia,"Aromas of very ripe and sweet fruit announce this rich, orange- and pineapple-dominated wine. Full on the palate, with the bright fruit singing.

147877,US,"Dark berries, earth and toasty oak all come together in this rich, heady Pinot. It may not have the grace of a prima ballerina, but it is full-bodied and satisfying. Probably best to drink over the next 2-3 years.",,87,28.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,,,,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse
147878,Australia,"At 85% Cabernet, this one starts off mildly hot and heavy, with pungent brambly aromas and a leathery, spicy undercurrent. The plum and raspberry flavors are overt, and it finishes with a slight burn. Aeration settles it down and softens it up, leaving a wine more akin to Pinot Noir than to Cabernet.",,87,20.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Hollick
147879,New Zealand,"A very herbaceous nose and lean grapefruit and gooseberry flavor profile make this a fairly textbook rendition of this certain style of Sauvignon Blanc.

147881,Australia,"Verdelho is a grape from Iberia that the Aussies are increasingly working with. The lime and herb qualities in this offering are attractive, and the mouthfeel is slightly chalky, in a positive manner.

147884,New Zealand,"Orange and floral scents are characteristic of the variety. Not overly sweet, but with 13.5% alcohol, this might be served best as an apéritif or to accompany foie gras rather than as a dessert wine; most desserts will simply be too sweet for it.",Late Harvest,86,12.0,Gisborne,,,,,,Muscat,Matua Valley
147885,Australia,"You get the better parts of both worlds here: It's both classy and casual. If it's slightly austere on its own, with sharpness and palate-scrubbing acids, just place some spicy food alongside it and you're home free. Ginger chicken is a particularly good match.

147886,Australia,"Here's a light and friendly wine that indicates that Australia is finding its way with the fickle grape of Burgundy.

147889,Australia,"Wines from this part of Western Australia are usually worth a look. This one qualifies, with its fine mouthfeel and good intentions.

147890,US,"One whiff tells you this is fine Zin: black cherry, raspberry, tobacco, earth, and plenty of black pepper and spice. Very soft and easy to drink.

147892,Australia,"Another solid vintage for Bin 65, one of the brands that for many people is synonymous with popular-priced Aussie Chardonnay.

Flavorful and affordable, and widely available.",Bin 65,86,10.0,South Australia,South Australia,,,,,Chardonnay,Lindemans
147893,Australia,"This perennial value leader scores again in the '98 vintage. It's definitely fruity, as it delivers the full complement of citrus, especially grapefruit.

147895,New Zealand,"From a Napa producer with an outpost in New Zealand. Australian-born Gerald Rowland's wine has a lovely nose of cherries, beets, cola, and green herbs. But it doesn't entirely fulfill that promise on the palate—the velvety cherries are there, but they're overlaid by a persistent green stemminess that promises longevity though not necessarily charm.",Jill's Vineyard,86,22.0,Central Otago,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Rowland

147897,Australia,"“Pristine” stands for untouched—in this case by wood, an increasingly popular approach to the Chardonnay grape in Australia. The light citrus aromas, herb and caramel accents, and a dry and lean mouthfeel with almost tart pineapple flavors bring to mind better Mâconnais wines from Burgundy. Well-balanced, it closes crisply with mild tropical-fruit notes. Likable, and not a fat, oaky tropical fruit bomb.",Pristine,86,15.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,,,,Chardonnay,Stanley Brothers
147898,Australia,"This unusual blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Merlot comes across as the beneficiary of lots of sun. It's big, chunky and sweet, with ample shadings of American oak. What it lacks in elegance is made up for in concentration and power. A little grapey, but spicy and leathery enough to qualify as a good quaffing wine rather than just ponderous grape juice.",Black Sheep,86,16.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,,,,Red Blend,Stanley Brothers

147903,US,"It has a deep, candy-red color, but the nose is anything but candied, showing aromas of green olives, herbs and blackberries. Salivatingly tart and only slightly sweet.

It's not subtle, and would probably work with Buffalo wings.",Rose,80,7.0,California,California,California Other,,,,Merlot,Sutter Home
147904,US,"This is sensuous Chardonnay that provides plenty of texture and depth without being heavy. The bouquet is robust and complex, with pear, smoke, vanilla, cumin and an appealing oatmeal-graham cracker-like note. A full spectrum of similarly ripe fruit flavors coats the mouth, bolstered by good acidity, and you can almost sink your teeth into the full, chewy mouthfeel. This very impressive bottling finishes long and complex, with grainy pear, spice and buttery notes. Editors' Choice.",,93,34.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Darioush
147905,US,"An intensely fragrant floral, ginger, peach, lemon-lime and orange-spice bouquet ushers in this smooth, well-structured wine. The palate shows intricately meshed orange, butterscotch and toasted nut flavors, offset by angular, racy mineral accents. Finishes long and crisp, with refined pineapple, citrus and stony flavors. Enjoyable now but still tight, this should offer even more in two years.",Laura's,93,54.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Hartford
147906,US,"This Napa stalwart is beautifully integrated. Leesy and citrus notes accent the solid apple and toast profile on both the nose and in the mouth.

147907,US,"There's plenty of ripe fruit in this 1998. An intense nose of coconut, jasmine, sweet pineapple, toasted marshmallow and cloves opens this lush beauty.

147908,US,"Taut and intensely structured, the compact smoke, lime, ginger and nut bouquet here hints at what's within. The mouth offers lime and chalk, vanilla and apples and a creamy yet firm mouthfeel—it's surprisingly full, with bright acidity.

Opens with a wonderful nose of peach, tropical fruit, nuts and orange tea; it shows great poise and a classic sense of proportion from bouquet to finish. The wine unfolds and expands in the glass, offering lovely orange, mineral and tarragon flavors. The engaging finish has great length and subtle aromas and flavors.

147910,US,"One of seven wines we tasted from this renowned vineyard, and one of six from veteran Chard-meister Jed Steele. This one's a beauty—the top scoring wine from both the winemaker and the site.

147911,US,"This is everything a flagship wine should be, with its rich mouthfeel, palate-coating flavors and long finish.

147913,US,"Ripe orange and papaya, spice, graham cracker and smoke are a few of the adjectives tasters used to describe the nose of this delightful wine. Though rich and open on the palate, it never gets loose or sloppy. A great chalk element and spice accents nicely offset the rich fruit foundation.

147916,US,"Deep pineapple and orange fruit is wrapped in a deep, toasty oak envelope in this Russian River classic. There are complex nutty, leesy, burnt sugar and even vaguely meaty notes on the nose.

147917,US,"This Chardonnay reads on the nose and palate like key lime pie. Sweet and sour citrus notes are offset by graham cracker, vanilla and ginger snap. This is great juice with plenty of dimension—at once smooth and full, creamy and spicy. Don't drink it for dessert, though—try it with grilled chicken in a citrus and spice marinade.

It shows the aforementioned elements, plus cinnamon, clove and vanilla flavors. What you get is a ripe, unctuous wine—big, maybe even a bit overblown, but totally lovable.

147922,US,"Displaying great fruit and excellent structure, this can be enjoyed now, but it has soon scale and intensity that we suggest aging it for at least another year or two.

148035,Spain,"Rusty in color, with nutty, leathery aromas that feature little to no fruit. Quite sour in the mouth, and drying on the finish.

148038,Spain,"Balsamic vinegar, burnt coffee and pepper aromas create a bouquet that's more like salad dressing than fine wine. The flavors are peppery and herbal, yet the body is full and the mouthfeel not bad. A blend of four grapes, led by Garnacha and Tempranillo. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Tinto Joven,80,11.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,,,,Red Blend,Señorio de Aylés

148042,US,"What a wonderfully complex, satisfying wine. It combines the steely acidity the vineyard regularly contributes with massively ripe tropical fruit flavors to produce a real stunner. Rich in mango custard, key lime pie, pineapple sorbet, vanilla pudding and smoky oak, it has a crispness that makes the flavors sing. Best in its youth, and should hold for a good five years.",Ramal Vineyard Clone 17RY,94,34.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Buena Vista
148043,US,"It's fun to compare this to the winery's Ramal Vineyard bottling. This is tighter still, a young, crisp, minerally Chard, racy and elegant in pineapple, mango and buttered toast, with the high acidity associated with this vineyard. It's a fine, complex wine now, and should hold for at least five years, possibly longer.",Ramal Vineyard Dijon Clones,93,34.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Buena Vista
148044,US,"Here's a delicious wine, rich and forward in flavor. These Dijon clones produce exceptionally clean, bright fruit, and this Pinot bursts with cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb and cola flavors. It's fully dry, with subtle complexities from oak. Great now and for the next five years, but don't hold it so long that it loses its fruity youthfulness.",Ramal Vineyard Dijon Clones,92,,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,,,,Pinot Noir,Buena Vista
148045,US,"Swan is the old, pre-Dijon clonal selection used by so many wineries. The wine has a youthful character, a little sharp right now, but there's brilliant promise. Crisp in acids, fairly tannic, but loaded with dramatically ripe cherry and pomegranate fruit, this is one to lay down. Best after 2008, but fine now with a rich duck presentation.",Ramal Vineyard Swan Selection,92,,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,,,,Pinot Noir,Buena Vista
148046,US,"It must be the coolness of the estate, because even in this hot vintage, this wine is dry, tannic and relatively moderate in alcohol. It's an old-fashioned Napa Cab, in the best sense, made in a balanced, ageworthy style that impressed before the modern era of superripe opulence. Fine now, and should hold and improve for a good ten years.",Reserve,91,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,William Hill Estate
148047,US,"The most complete and compelling of Diamond Creek's trio of '02s, combining the opulent accessibility of Gravelly Meadow with the power and authority of Volcanic Hill. The aromas of cassis, red currants, cedar, tobacco and cigar box lead to massively packed Cabernet flavors wrapped in huge, dusty tannins. The wine is so balanced, so distinguished and complete. Decant now if you must drink it, but it should start to mellow by 2008, and then peak and hold through 2015 at least.",Red Rock Terrace,97,175.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek
148048,US,"This shows winemaker Greg LaFollette's master touch in the way he's balanced the wine and kept it harmonious. It's a huge mouthful of cherry pie and cassis flavor, with the most delicate notes of raspberries, toasted meringue and vanilla, subtlely spiced and dry. A gorgeous Pinot Noir that superbly combines power with elegance.",30th Anniversary Cuvee,96,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,,Pinot Noir,De Loach
148049,US,"Starts off as a closed, tight wine, aromatically speaking, and needs plenty of decanting to breathe, but once it starts to open, there's an eruption of the most refined cassis and cedar aromas. In the mouth, this is an immense Cabernet, profoundly deep in blackberry, roasted coffee and dark chocolate flavors. It is also enormously tannic, and is effectively locked down. Nowhere near ready, although decanting will help it, but it's best to hold this magnificent wine until 2007, when it should start to open, and then for at least 10 additional years.",Volcanic Hill,95,175.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek

148052,US,"There's plenty of apple, melon, and citrus fruit in this dry, stylish wine. Has a nice earthy streak that hits midpalate, then turns ripe and generous on the finish.

148053,New Zealand,"Ripe, verging on sweet, aromas of green apples and citrus show only a little of the gooseberry fragrance normally associated with Kiwi Sauvignons.

148054,Australia,"Here's a very interesting Chard packed with citrus, tropical fruit, and spice, and just the right touch of toasty oak.

Others will appreciate the structure.",,85,7.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Chardonnay,McPherson Wine Company
148055,Australia,"A polished wine with an array of ripe fruits ranging from apple and peach to tropical fruit. It's clean and sharp, thanks to high acidity. The fruit flavor is a bit simple, veering to lemon and lime, but it sure cleans the palate.",,85,15.0,South Australia,Padthaway,,,,,Chardonnay,Lindemans
148056,Australia,"A tannic but friendly quaffer that improves with time in the glass. The cured meat and tobacco notes don't exactly connect with the sweet-tart fruit. Unlike all the black-fruit-driven Shirazes, this one is basically cherries and plums. The finish is fresh and short, and here the tannins really show their teeth.",,85,10.0,South Australia,South Australia,,,,,Shiraz,Bulletin Place
148057,US,"Fans of upfront fruit will have problems with this earthy, tannic wine. Fresh out of the bottle, the aromas are of cherry tomatoes and herbs, and the wine tastes loamy and herbaceous.

148058,Australia,"Very bright, even sharp, this unoaked (Aquercus means without oak) Chardonnay reads very much like a Sauvignon Blanc.

Great zing, but a different thing.",Aquercus Unwooded,85,10.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,,,,Chardonnay,Wise
148059,Australia,"Light in color, this Aussie offering brings to mind wines of the Mâcon, with its mildly spicy fruit and herb nose, dry citrus and chalk palate, and lean, lightly talc-like mouthfeel.

148061,Australia,"Full aromas of peach, pears, and toast open this very straightforward (and very successful over the last decade) Aussie Chardonnay. Good mouthfeel. Apple, mild tropical-fruit and toast flavors make it a winner. Solid and quite widely available, if perhaps a touch hotter and less well-defined than in its best years.",,85,12.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Chardonnay,Rosemount
148062,Australia,"An interesting mix is at work here: You get the Chardonnay body and pear flavors and some nuttiness from the 60% Sémillon. Quite a straight-ahead wine, with more neutrality than nuance; the flavor profile ultimately veers toward citrus and almond. Overall it's forward and clean-tasting, with enough creaminess to satisfy.",,85,7.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,White Blend,McPherson Wine Company
148063,Australia,"This is a pretty good wine; fruity, spicy, ripe, round and supple, with classic green-apple and peach notes mingling with spicy, creamy, vanilla complexities. Interesting in that it uses Russian oak, with good results. Seems to have a little residual sugar, but high acidity balances things out.",,85,18.0,Victoria,Rutherglen,,,,,Chardonnay,Warrabilla
148064,Australia,"Pulsating honey and pear aromas announce the sweetness that follows. Like many Aussie Chards, this is a huge mouthful of pineapple, banana and other tropical fruits. A touch of welcome bitterness offers some balance to the heavy finish.",,84,10.0,South Australia,South Australia,,,,,Chardonnay,Buckeley's
148065,US,"From some of Monterey's best growing regions comes this light but likable wine. The racy flavors veer toward tropical fruits and citrus, and while it's a little on the simple side, the wine is clean and spicy. Fairly high acidity gives it a bit of a tingle.",,84,12.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Hahn
148066,US,"This is a nice, clean wine that has more fruit and class than you'd think at this giveaway price.

148067,US,"It smells of apple pie, pears and spearmint. Tastes of pineapple, green apple and oak. Some residual sugar lends a fruit-cocktail element to a wine that shows its best when well chilled.

148069,US,"Chunky in the nose, with a touch of tomato, oak, chocolate and wet dog. Looks heavy and dark in the glass, which tips off the round, hefty mouthfeel. There's a grapey/raisiny quality to the fruit, which is low-acid. The finish is smooth enough, with unassertive tannins and ample length.",Laetitia Vyd,84,32.0,California,San Luis Obispo County,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Blackjack

148071,Australia,"Wood and apple aromas open this wine, and the profile continues onto the palate. Fairly weighty in the mouth, but the body is almost all from the oak. Closes rather one-dimensionally, too, with quite heavy wood that suppresses the fruit.",,83,13.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,,,,Chardonnay,Wynns Coonawarra Estate
148072,Australia,"A little damp-smelling, with mushroom, mint and chocolate aromas, but not much fruit.

The fruit falls into the cranberry-and-cherry range.",,83,15.0,South Australia,Limestone Coast,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Heathfield Ridge

148074,US,"Hints of the bright tropical-fruit aromas the Salinas Valley is known for emerge, but they're accompanied by earthier notes.

148078,Australia,"The nose is somewhat funky and earthy here, and doesn't show the lean fruit and herb elements the grape is capable of.

148079,US,"Smells heavy for a Pinot, with aromas of fresh cement, earth, and—faintly—blackberry. Tannins are light enough, and there's some fruit there, but the overall impression is heavy-handed.

148080,US,"Long known for their powerful, elegant Chardonnays, Chalk Hill's 1998 offering is impressive for its complex array of aromas and flavors.

148081,US,"A winning wine that displays a vibrantly fragrant tangerine, citrus and herb-butter bouquet. It opens to a full, dense tropical-fruit palate and shows an almost seamless texture.

148082,US,"One of a back-to-back pair of strong performances from Foley, this wine opens with well-defined herb, caramel and cream nose. Ripe apple and toasted oak flavors round out the rich, buttery palate. The citrus and peach finish goes on forever. Shows complexity, but with a straight-ahead style that make it a real pleaser. Great now.",Barrel Select,91,38.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Foley
148083,US,"Bob Lindquist's 1999 offering displays a lovely opening of tropical fruit and vanilla custard beneath a smoky veil. The palate's understated nectarine, pear, pineapple flavors are bolstered by firm but not sharp acidity. The mouthfeel is crisp; the wine's fine structure shows through the tangy, nut-pepper finish. Already impressive, but warrants cellaring for two or three years. Top Value.",Bien Nacido Reserve,91,30.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Qupé
148084,US,"An intoxicating bouquet of clove, ripe orange, peach and melon promises a lot, but this wine delivers. The similarly heady palate of creamy, ripe tropical fruit is almost romantic, the richly textured mouthfeel full and lush. Finishes long in the same sensuous manner.

148085,US,"The ripe bouquet shows rich banana, butter and pineapple aromas.

148086,US,"A seductive nose of pineapple, pear, vanilla and buttered toast leads, followed by a nicely knit, well-fruited, but not-at-all sweet palate. Here, pear, melon, pineapple and tangerine is offset by light toast and vanilla accents. Balanced and smoothly textured, it shows graceful restraint that suggests it will improve over the next year or two.",,91,32.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Cakebread
148087,US,"This is a full, round and juicy wine, with pronounced orange, tangerine and pineapple aromas and flavors. Wonderful hints of vanilla and spice accent the bright tangy core of citrus fruit.

Elegant and appealingly fresh.",Great Estates,91,35.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Kendall-Jackson
148089,US,"A very ripe tropical-fruit nose is complemented beautifully by an intense smoky-toasty element. Pineapple, mango and caramel flavors stand out on the full palate: The smoky note resurfaces later, riding out the persistent finish. This is a sleek, stylish, but very solidly built Chardonnay. It pushes all the right sensory buttons, with big body and great lines, like a '56 Buick.","Reserve Unfined, Unfiltered",91,58.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Jarvis
148090,US,"Joseph Phelps's flagship Chardonnay is a study in sophisticated style. A fragrant peach, pineapple, smoke and floral bouquet might, in other wines, be overpowering, but here it is subtly seductive. Rich peach, tart orange and oat flavors ride the velvety palate, and the long, suave finish displays tangerine, peaches and cream aromas and flavors. There are layers of nuance to explore here—savor this one slowly.",Ovation,91,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Joseph Phelps
148091,US,"From the orange, creamy buttermilk and earthy notes on the nose to the dry mineral, herb and Asian pear palate, there's much to savor here—such as the balance, proportion and long, citrus-mineral finish. This is a complex and reserved wine, not a conventional, in-your-face bottling. It's rather tight now, but if you give it two years (or more!), you'll be well rewarded.",Diamond T Estate,91,55.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Talbott
148092,US,"The third vintage of the Beringer senior winemaker's namesake bottling is robust, yet approachable. This wine is lavishly—to some, overly oaked, but it's one of the best of this style. Apple, cinnamon bun, and smoke aromas give way to caramel, vanilla and spice flavors. Add a rich, round mouthfeel, and you've got a very seductive package. This wine is more about vigorous style, flavor and texture than subtlety. Only die-hard anti-oaksters will be able to resist its appeal.",Sbragia-Limited Release,91,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Beringer
148093,US,"Another elegant wine from Cambria. This one has a vanilla, smoke and grapefruit nose. Medium-weight, it is crisp in the mouth, though somewhat leaner than the Bench Break.

148094,US,"Crème brûlée creaminess combines with tart citrus fruitiness in this wine, which displays great balance and richness.

148095,US,"Full and fat with a delightful mix of tropical fruit and new oak spiciness.

148100,US,"This plush Chardonnay's bouquet shows an ultraripe botrytis note in its vanilla, peach, clove and caramel aromas.

148101,US,"A tart pineapple-lemon nose with caramel and smoke accents ushers in a full palate. Apple and pear flavors add body, and a chalky note contributes complexity and texture to the palate. Slight creaminess provides a fat, full feel, but maybe just a bit more softness than some tasters preferred. Still, this is a solid wine with finesse and body. It displays both smoky toast and bright orange-lemon notes on the finish.",Mon Plaisir,90,60.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Peter Michael Winery
148102,US,"The graceful, subtle nose of pears, apples and hazelnuts don't prepare you for the richness of this old-guard Napa producer's 1999 offering.

148103,US,"Butter and vanilla wrap around tropical fruit and citrus flavors on the full nose. Baked apples, crème caramel and abundant new oak merge to provide this chard with a slightly viscous, buttery texture. Its rich butter and oak may be a bit too much for some. The tangy finish is long and tasty.",Reserve,90,59.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Harrison
148104,US,"This appealing Chardonnay is the same wine that carried a reserve designation in prior vintages. It's lushly woven and has aromas and flavors of pear, pineapple and peach.

148105,France,"Aromas of clove, strong, spicy oak and sublimated cherry open this hard-to-decipher wine.

148199,US,"Awesome wine, big, brooding and tannic, yet amazingly rich in fruit, this is one for the cellar. Massive blackberry, coffee and chocolate fruit flavors are well-integrated with smoky oak, and the finish is huge, long and fruity-spicy. A real beauty now, but so immature, it would be a shame not to give it four or five more years to develop additional bottle complexities.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,93,50.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,,,,Syrah,Bonaccorsi
148200,US,"Ginger snap and graham cracker aromas share the field with golden apple, menthol and lemongrass on the nose.

It's full but not heavy, and balances fruit and acidity, sweetness and tartness, and light and full elements. The positive fruit, style and restraint are notable.",Reserve,90,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Robert Mondavi

148206,US,"Apple and tropical fruit aromas accented by mint, grass and herbal notes open to an equally bright palate of pineapple, mango and citrus flavors.

148211,US,"One of two Byron bottlings from this source; this one should be less difficult to find in stores.

148286,Bulgaria,"Although this may not come across like a Merlot, it still offers great value. Plenty of vanilla mixes with deep berry and spice aromas, while the dark, extracted mouth offers a lush feel with good tannin matched with black berry and white pepper.",,86,7.0,Sliven,,,,,,Meritage,Vini
148287,Argentina,"Very oaky, with a can't-miss scent of butter, and also some maple. Sweet and syrupy on first take but then it settles down to deliver licorice, cooked brown sugar and toast. What's best about this wine is its feel.",Q,86,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,,,,Tempranillo,Zuccardi
148288,Italy,"Lime soda and lollipop-like aromas are flanked by stone fruit and grapefruit. Crisp, clean characteristics are carried through to the mouth, where more candy flavors ride over a crisp finish.",Gorio Extra Dry,86,,Veneto,Prosecco di Valdobbiadene,,,,,Prosecco,Malibràn
148289,Australia,"The nose is very pretty: Graham cracker, vanilla bean, maybe some blueberry pie. On the palate, the wine deals straightforward plum fruit overlaid with oak.",Basket Pressed,86,19.0,South Australia,Riverland,,,,,Petit Verdot,Pennyfield Wines
148290,US,"The vineyard is owned by Foley, which produces great Pinot, and what they all have in common is rich acidity, an uncommonly complete structure, and a clean purity of Pinot Noir fruit. This bottle is dry and fuller-bodied than Brewer-Clifton's other Pinots, although it retains those lovely red stone fruits that are so elegant. It's a tight, young wine that needs to be decanted, and should drink well through its sixth birthday.",Rancho Santa Rosa,93,56.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Brewer-Clifton
148291,US,"This is from Dan Morgan Lee's own vineyard. It's in the coolest northwest part of the appellation, near its boundary, and is more acidic and elegant than his purchased Pinots further south. The 2004 vintage was blazingly hot, and the grapes loved it. Big in cherry, cola, leather and spice flavors, it's a wine to savor. Best now through 2008.",Double L Vineyard,93,55.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Morgan
148292,US,"Always a rewarding wine, this year's Etoile is particularly rich. It floods the palate with complex fruit spanning the gamut from lemons and limes to pineapples and guavas.

148293,France,"The 20 different parcels that go to make up Fines Caillottes add up to 52 acres, a large estate for the region. Alain Pabiot makes an impressively classic Pouilly-Fumé, with the pure fruit of the Sauvignon made more subtle with flavors of herbs and a fine, poised structure. An excellent wine, and one that  will certainly age well. Imported by Henry Wine Group.",Domaine des Fines Caillottes,92,,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Jean Pabiot et Fils
148294,US,"You might take this for a Cab because of the intensely pure cassis entry. Then in the midpalate, the prettiest cherries show up, along with lots of new-oaky flavors and elaborate tannins. All the parts are pretty in this exceptionally smooth, stylish Merlot. A great price for such a wine.",,92,25.0,California,Yountville,Napa,,,,Merlot,Noah
148295,US,"Most of the grapes are from the winery's original 1959 planting. It's a beautiful, refined Sauvignon Blanc, brimming with lemon and lime, freshly mowed green grass and tangy green apple flavors. Partial barrel fermentation adds a creamy complexity. The wine is totally dry and bright in acidity, but it's really the fruit that stars.",,92,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Rochioli
148296,Austria,"Lush and ripe, but it still retains that signature white pepper-celery leaf note that's a sure sign of the variety.

148298,US,"This is a very fine Cabernet, a bit too young for complete enjoyment now due to tough mountain tannins, but there's a fleshy opulence to the fruit. Totally dry, the wine feels rich and balanced, and is Bordeaux-like in its feminine elegance, suggesting a fine St.-Julien. Hold until 2008.",,92,65.0,California,Napa,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barnett
148299,France,"Lucien and his son, Gilles, are two of the best technicians in Sancerre: Their wines always have great purity of fruit. But with Le Chêne (the oak tree), they also have a fine, delicious wine that bursts with almond, toast and ripe fruit, as well as exuberant citrus flavors. This is Sauvignon Blanc at its freshest.

148300,Australia,"This vintage doesn't really gel with the wine's typically earthy character, but it is delicious, in any case.

148301,US,"Composed of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon from the biodynamic En Cerise Vineyard, and 40% Syrah from Seven Hills. The fruit has a touch of the good funk the French call gout de merde, and the wine has a big spine of tarry tannin. This is tight and ageworthy; if you drink it soon you'd best decant it early.",The Creator,92,45.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,K Vintners
148302,US,"Big Syrah, and an obvious ager due to the thick, young tannins and relative closedness. But the fruit is so enormous in black cherry compote, chocolate and cassis, and everything is so balanced and harmonious, that the wine cannot fail to improve. Best  by 2008, and will hold for some years beyond.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,92,40.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,,,,Syrah,Ojai
148303,Portugal,"Another Port success from the Branco family of Quinta do Portal, following their success with the 2003 vintage.

148304,US,"An extra level of moss, tar and licorice is evident here.

A star.",Reserve,92,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stevens
148305,US,"There's a rich streak of mineral that undergirds tremendous ripe tropical fruit, along with crisp acidity and a good amount of smoky oak that's perfectly integrated with the rich fruit. Tremendous extract and weight and a long, impressive finish make this wine addictively good.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,92,33.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Tantara
148306,US,"Don't let the nondescript label fool you; this is serious juice. Dark, sappy, spicy and dense, it comes on with flavors of baking chocolate and smoked meat, scented with violets and citrus, and finishes with bracing green tea tannins. A strong, muscular, substantial effort.",,92,19.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Syrah,Rulo Winery
148307,US,"Compared this to the winery's Cabernet Sauvignon, it's softer, richer and more accessible despite the big tannins that will enable the wine to age. Flavorwise, you'll find a delicious mélange of blackberry, cherry, plum, coffee and herb flavors that are intricate and complexed by flashy new oak. Drink now through 2014.",Sori Bricco Vineyard,92,70.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,,,,Red Blend,Von Strasser
148308,Portugal,"Powered with acidity and its firm structure, this is an intensely dry, concentrated, powerful wine.

Graham's
148309,Australia,"Good as ever, this vintage of the Yangarra Shiraz doles out plenty of juicy blackberry and blueberry fruit accented with fresh but subtle vanilla bean notes.

148310,US,"This is two-thirds Cab Sauvignon and one-third Cab Franc. Very well constructed with soft, rich, broad fruit showing ripe raspberry and cherry flavors.

Despite its ripeness it retains just the right hint of cool-climate herb, adding interest and nuance to the finish.",Deluge Red Wine,92,40.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Blend,Lake Missoula
148311,US,"The color is fairly light, a lovely translucent ruby, so the weight of this wine comes as something of a surprise. Boasts big flavors: ripe black cherry, and tart, concentrated cola and vanilla flavors enhanced with smoky, spicy oak. Yet the wine is nicely dry, and offset by acidity. Drink now and through 2010.",Garys' Vineyard,92,50.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Morgan
148312,US,"This enormously ripe wine shines with a purity of tropical fruit and candied citrus flavors that are generously oaked.

Drink this Burgundian-style Chardonnay soon for its youthful opulence.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,92,28.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Ojai
148313,US,"What a young, powerful wine this is. From the first sniff, an assault of dried cherry, licorice and Asian spice, to the lasting impression of tannins, all this wine wants to do is open up. Decanting, even overnight, will help to soften and round it out. It's a superb wine, rich and elaborate, but a little hot in alcohol, which may limit the ageworthiness. Drink now through 2008.",Mount Carmel,92,72.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Brewer-Clifton
148314,France,"Not labeled as late-harvest, but this wine is noticeably sweet, rich and mouthcoating. Honey, baked apple and cinnamon flavors easily glide across the palate, buttressed by just enough acidity to keep it from becoming cloying. Might be best with foie gras or cheese.

148315,US,"Powerful, youthful and still a bit raw, the newest release of DeLille's signature red blend shows a range of fruit from cherry and blackberry to dark notes of raisin and balsamic.

148317,US,"From Yountville, an elegant wine with a dollop of Cabernet for complexity. It's delicious in pure, cassis-laced cherry kirsch and blueberry flavors, with fine oak seasoning.

148318,US,"Classic Napa Cabernet, rich and sensuous in tannins that are fully approachable now, with ripe black currant and mocha flavors enriched with smoky, spicy oak. The wine is nicely dry.

148319,Portugal,"Although part of Barros, Kopke still operates relatively independently, and obviously can draw on good stocks of aged tawnys.

148320,US,"This is hefty, dry and structured Chardonnay. Offers a complex musky, creamy nose that ushers in a range of tart citrus, coconut, toasted nut and mineral flavors.

148321,US,"Aromas of ripe cantaloupe, vanilla and tropical fruits plus creamy malolactic notes show on the nose of this limited-production Napa Chardonnay.

148323,US,"In good vintages, Trefethen reserves a special portion of their Chardonnay production for late release in their Library Selection series.

148324,US,"Refined and inviting, the bouquet offers caramel, hazelnuts and toast. Dark apple, toast, spice and earth flavors fill the mouth. The mouthfeel is rich and dense, though a touch more fruit would really have it singing. Finishes with spice and faint lime notes, and a toasty oak flavor that really takes over.

148325,US,"This Carneros Chardonnay shows solid mainstream style. Apple, caramel and mint aromas on the nose open to apple, coconut and menthol-oak flavors.

148327,US,"This is an impressive bottling with complex caramel, toasted nut and tropical fruit aromas. It's big bodied and coats the mouth with rich butterscotch, banana, apple and toasty oak flavors. A touch short on acid, it could use bit more backbone, but it's still big on toasty style.

148329,US,"This big, brawny Chardonnay's potent nose of smoke, hay, orange, banana and pungent lees is an attention-grabber. Baked apple, buttered popcorn, and vanilla flavors come on strong along with an edge of spicy oak that carries through the finish. The panel rendered a split decision on this wine from veteran winemaker David Ramey. It showed harmony, length and finesse to some, but appeared edgy, a bit disjointed and obvious to others.",Hudson Vineyard,89,55.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Ramey

148335,US,"The green apple and menthol toast bouquet shows some unusual tobacco-like aromas that are usually associated with red wines.

148337,US,"A presently reined-in wine with exotic elements, showing a ginger, saffron and green apple bouquet. It's well-balanced, with lively apple and citrus flavors.

148338,US,"The bouquet is like an aromatic walk in the woods—it has pine, earth and floral elements as well as the expected fruit aromas.

148340,US,"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay shows smoky new oak and telltale matchstick leesy aromas. Real spiciness comes through on the palate. The apple fruit wears strong clove, nutmeg and butterscotch notes. There's a firm acid backbone that's lively, but slightly jarring to some tasters.

148341,US,"The complex smoke, earth, spice and mineral aromas that open this wine are followed by subdued tangerine and citrus flavors, dried spice and mineral accents on an oaky frame.

148343,US,"Mint, fresh fruit and decidedly floral aromas led to yet another split-decision wine you may just have to taste yourself. Some tasters found elegance, white stone fruits, citrus and good acidity leading to a rich, silky finish with buttery and nutty notes. Others (same bottle!) found it soft, sweet and a bit cloying in a “your auntie's perfume” manner.

148347,US,"Smooth and creamy from start to finish, this wine is a dead-on mainstream pleaser. Begins with a nutty and toasty nose that also shows traces of apple and lemon.

148411,US,"Attractive pear, citrus, melon and mild spice aromas open this lean and elegant wine. The mouthfeel is light, but not insubstantial and slightly tense (in a good way), showing good acid spine, crisp citrus flavors and taut mineral accents.

148412,US,"Susie Selby's homage to her late father has some sulfur and earthy notes on the nose, but there's good fruit behind.

148413,US,"Aromas of movie popcorn, hops and Asian pear open this rather over-the-top wine.

148416,France,"A nose of tart strawberry scents, spice and just a slight stemmy note opens this decent value in Pinot Noir.

148418,US,"The historic estate's 1998 is characteristically lean, angular and fairly closed. The bouquet of apple cider, anise, and fragrant jasmine-like notes opens to a trim palate of green apple and toast flavors, and a taut mouthfeel.

148419,US,"Tasters pegged apples, anise, crème brûlée and cinnamon in the lively nose of this rich wine—one that also sparked some controversy. The straight-ahead flavor profile is appealing, with solid apple, clove and butterscotch offset by the attractive anise streak. But is it native yeast or heavy malolactic fermentation that's responsible for the mixed feelings some panelists expressed? Concerns were noted about a dairy-like note on the nose and also a slick, yet gummy texture. Nevertheless, the winning aromas and flavors kept the overall take positive.",VGS,87,45.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Château Potelle
148420,Australia,"This pleasant, medium-weight white from an Iberian grape shows why it has caught on among our adventurous Aussie cousins.

148424,US,"Lavishly oaked from the first whiff on the nose and palate, dense toasty notes envelope the pineapple and tropical fruit. Plenty of vanilla and both a tangy nuttiness and a creaminess from the oak, provide a nice mouthfeel tension. Panelists had two schools of thought about this wine: The oak totally dominates—certainly now—and how you feel about that determines your take on the wine. Lacking fruit? Or just tight and needing a year or two to open? Only time will tell.",Reserve,87,58.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,Jarvis
148425,US,"This sunny, medium-gold wine opens with caramel and apple aromas.

148427,US,"Pear, pineapple and herb aromas intrigued some tasters, but others found an odd note in this wine's nose. Vanilla, pear, apple and sweet spices mark the medium-weight and round palate.

148428,US,"This Chard displays a slightly unusual but appealing sweet and sour streak. The bouquet shows tart green apples, grapefruit, stewed fruit and sweet herbs, plus tangy green oak shadings.

148429,US,"The bouquet of Farrell's wine is a mixed bag of buttered popcorn, minerals, herbs, citrus fruit, pineapple and melon stuffed in an oak envelope.

148432,US,"A full and creamy bouquet announces a palate laden with ripe golden delicious apple, vanilla, and melon flavors, with chalk, mineral and earth elements.

148433,US,"This Napa Valley mainstay's offering shows a firm acid backbone and crisp, bright green apple flavors with lemony accents.

148434,US,"The full fresh-bread aromas of yeast, honey, oats promise much body, but the palate delivers a dry citrus-mineral mouthful of flavors.

148437,US,"This very rare, single-vineyard Chardonnay has distinct vanilla, golden delicious apple, banana and peach flavors—a nice mix of sweet and sour, but some tasters found searing acidity and a sharp metallic note.

Only 132 cases produced.",Dierberg Vineyard,87,35.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Foley
148438,US,"A big nose of toasty oak, vanilla and butterscotch opens this offering. There are hints of pear and apple fruit, but the palate has a dominating oakiness and a custardy fatness.

148439,US,"Respected vineyard source and established record of the winemaker notwithstanding, the dense gunpowder/matchstick quality here isn't easy to take—or even read.

148441,Hungary,"This Cab Franc offers a young, fresh side of the variety, low in tannin but high in vibrant berry flavors. Colored a rich purple, a hint of barbecue adds some character to this pleasant wine. Imported by MHW, Ltd.",,85,9.0,Szekszárd,,,,,,Cabernet Franc,Craftsman

148443,Argentina,"Closed and heavy on the nose, with baked-apple flavors and caramel. Weighs in as full-bodied, with toffee and bitter pith notes on the finish. Aims fairly high and delivers up to an extent: there's size and substance but also some overripeness, corn and pith. Not perfect, but not bad. Imported by Billington Imports.",,85,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,,,,Chardonnay,Felipe Rutini
148444,Italy,"This Pinot Grigio is etched with nice mineral tones. But there's also a broad, almost flat, quality to the mouth that holds a lot of the potential fruitiness back. Imported by Stock USA Ltd.",,85,6.0,Southern Italy,Terra degli Osci,,,,,Pinot Grigio,Azienda Vinicola Fratelli Fabiano
148445,Argentina,"Intensely colored and miles better than the label's troubled basic Tempranillo, this is an Argentinean rendition of Spain's workhorse grape that showcases berry and plum flavors, plenty of oak and ample chocolate and espresso on the finish. More impressive when taken as a whole; best to drink with barbecue and not get too analytical.",Reserva Especial,85,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,,,,Tempranillo,Finca El Retiro
148446,Australia,"Aromas are very pungent: yellow pineapple, peach, mustard seed—another reviewer even noted some corn notes.

Imported by Southland Wines.",Billy Goat Hill,85,22.0,South Australia,Lenswood,,,,,Chardonnay,Golding
148447,Australia,"Most of the higher-tier Grant Burge Shirazes this vintage were excellent, so maybe it's not such a surprise that this one is just good. There's a kirsch-ish aspect to the plummy nose, plus tangy oak. Oak and plum are reprised on the palate; a little rough on the tongue, and finishes short. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",Miamba,85,19.0,South Australia,Barossa,,,,,Shiraz,Grant Burge
148448,US,"High in alcohol and a little hot and baked in fruit, this single vineyard wine typifies that style from a hot vintage in California. The stewed berry and raisiny-pruny flavors finish fully dry. This Zin will nicely complement a rich beef stew.",,85,28.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,,,,Zinfandel,Guerrero Fernandez

148450,Macedonia,"Full, dry, round, and balanced in the mouth, this wine attempts greatness. But aside from oak-based flavors, it doesn't deliver.

148455,Argentina,"Fairly oaky, as the name might indicate. Flavors of lemon, apple and pineapple are complete, if a bit common, while the feel is round and a touch resiny.

Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Oak Cask,85,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,,,,Chardonnay,Trapiche
148456,Argentina,"Although it kicks off on the stewy, baked side of the fence, airing reveals good fruit and ample wood; indeed, there's brandied cherry, vanilla and chocolate to ponder.

148457,Italy,"The nose is Granny Smith apple in as pure a form you can get in winemaking. But there's also a distant note of rubber balloon that, to be honest, I rather liked.

148461,Italy,"There's a slightly lactic quality to the wine that muddles the flavors and aromas. Instead of peach, you get peach yogurt and instead of citrus, you get lemon cream.

148462,Argentina,"Raspberry, bramble and leather are convincing opening aromas, while the ripe black cherry on the palate is spiced up by some light wood notes.

148464,US,"The first vineyard-designated Cabernet from Indian Wells, this is much softer than recent vintages of the winery's Cabernets, but in this instance the wine feels stripped. The fruit and core are like shadows seen through a veil, and despite their softness, the tannins still outweigh the rest.

148470,Australia,"Stylized and excellent Shiraz. Briar and chili powder aromas are subtle; the wine is broad on the palate, with flavors of plum, raspberry and vanilla bean.

148473,US,"Drinks young, crisp in acids and a little impertinent now, but with great charm; this wine is alive with vibrant cherry, mint and oak flavors that finish in a swirl of chocolate raspberry mousse.

Drink soon.",Garys' Vineyard,91,45.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Lucia
148474,Australia,"Delicious, precise and excellent, but this Riesling isn't built to satisfy the masses. Its acidity is scouring and it gives the wine a tartness that makes your mouth water.

148476,Australia,"One of Australia's most noted dessert wines does not disappoint: It's medium-full in the mouth, with warming burnt sugar and meat aromas, which are followed up by apricot, peach and butterscotch flavors and a dry finish.

Imported by De Bortoli Wines USA Inc.",Noble One Botrytis,91,29.0,New South Wales,New South Wales,,,,,Sémillon,De Bortoli
148477,France,"This Riesling has extra levels of intensity and energy that set it apart from the crowd.

148478,US,"This is a tart, racy, exciting wine, showing just a hint of brett, but as a viable accent note.

148480,Australia,"A steak lover's Cab made in an old-school style, sturdy but not brash.

148481,US,"Rusack turns to two vineyards, including Bien Nacido, for their reserve Chard, which is richer and finer than their regular county-wide botting.

148482,US,"Made from the old Clone 1, which gives classic grass and citrus flavors, and the Musqué clone, which contributes brighter gooseberry notes.

This is one of the purest expressions of unoaked, non-malolactic Sauvignon Blanc in California.",,91,16.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Mauritson
148483,US,"The first impression of this Cab is that it's way too young. It has plenty of flash in the ripe Cabernet fruit, rich oak, dense tannins and crisp acidity, but those tannins hold the wine in lockdown, and the parts are far from coming together. In serious need of cellaring, this dynamic young wine should begin to be approachable by 2008.",Beckstoffer Vineyard X,91,75.0,California,Oakville,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Merryvale
148484,Austria,"Starts off with an intense blast of white pepper and celery leaf, but that's buffered by layers of ripe nectarines.

148487,France,"Dry Alsace Riesling this good at this price doesn't come along every day, so snap this one up while you can. Steely, minerally scents ally with ripe limes on the nose, then open up into richly layered waves of mineral, spice and green apple on the palate. Not rich or unctuous in texture, just nicely balanced from mineral start to long finish.",Beblenheim,90,25.0,Alsace,Alsace,,,,,Riesling,Domaine Marcel Deiss
148488,Australia,"This sticky pulls out all the stops; where words like “ripe, full, rich and sweet” are detriments to some wines they only explain this one's attractiveness. Apricot aromas are laid on thick, backed by some citrus and fig. Apricot, passion fruit, mango and burnt sugar emerge on the palate and through the finish.

148489,France,"Rather reined-in on the nose, this wine lacks Gewürz's over-the-top aromatics, instead showing restrained pear and spice scents. Combined with the wine's lack of residual sugar, this aspect of the wine will make it more versatile with food, as it pumps out apple, citrus and spice flavors that turn peppery on the finish.",Les Folastries,90,31.0,Alsace,Alsace,,,,,Gewürztraminer,Josmeyer

148493,France,"This is a great, intense, apples-and-cream style of wine. The acidity is certainly there, but the richness and the ripeness of the fruit dominate.

148494,Canada,"The nose explodes with oily aromas of dried apricot, golden raisin, lemon and musk. Full, rich and oily, with similar flavors to Mission Hill's other icewines, predominantly pineapple.

148495,Australia,"Has aromas of eucalyptus and earth, with more of the same on the palate accenting very taut mixed fruit.

148496,France,"From old vines, this intensely flavored wine is deliciously ripe, a product of the hot summer of 2005, but retains the essential acidity and citrus flavors of good Sancerre.

Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",Domaine de la Perrière,90,20.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Pierre Archambault
148497,US,"This was a tough vintage, with multiple days above 100¢ª during harvest, but winemaker John Falcone pulled it off.

Drink now.",,90,30.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Rusack
148498,US,"What's so interesting about this Chardonnay is the dryness and the earthy minerality. There are flavors of dried herbs and dried fruits, such as apricots, lemons and pink grapefruits.

148500,US,"The pleasant nose of nuts, green apples and caramel also shows an odd whiff that mattered more to some tasters than others. Light apple fruit, spice, earth and butterscotch notes play on the full, but vaguely sour milk-tinged palate. Finishes tart and dry with slight mineral notes, in the manner of some white Burgundies. We've been big fans of Foxen's wines in the past, but this one left us scratching our heads.",Tinaquaic Vineyard,86,30.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Foxen
148501,US,"This wine cuts a racy Chablis-like profile. Green apple and lemon-lime fruit, mild spices and a dry earthiness are all in play here. They ride on brisk acidity through a tart and minerally finish. A thoroughbred wine that, to some, “lacks stuffing.”",Huber Vineyard,86,32.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Longoria
148502,France,"Nice tension shows in the floral, peach and stony aromas of this estate wine. It has a lean frame and taut spine, but good fruit, too, with the gentle peachy notes balancing the crisp edge. Closes clean, with citrus and spice. Viré-Clessé is a new appellation replacing the Macon-Villages, -Viré or -Clessé formerly mandated.",Domaine des Combelières,86,14.0,Burgundy,Viré-Clessé,,,,,Chardonnay,Prosper Maufoux
148503,US,"Some panelists praised this Chardonnay's balance and zingy citrus flavors; others were put off by its potent, even overwhelming, oak and green woody aspects.

Carmel Vineyard,86,40.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Au Bon Climat
148504,US,"The nose here shows clean pine and citrus notes, with accents of herb and tropical fruit. Straightforward apple, pear and nut flavors show on the palate.

148505,US,"Slightly odd-scented nose with hints of pipe tobacco, grapefruit, green apple and herbs.

Pleasant hints of oak show up on the finish.",Reserve,86,30.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Morgan
148506,US,"This smooth wine has good balance, and a fairly full mouthfeel. Even on the palate, it shows a bit of both ends of the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum—the crisp grassy, herb and grapefruit side and also fig, pear and melon as foundation.",,86,16.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Rancho Zabaco
148507,US,"The nutty, smoky notes on the nose are overshadowed by taut, high-octane alcohol-mineral scents. The stony, mineral-laden palate also shows earthy, apple-oatmeal flavors. The mouthfeel is full, yet tight (we could say ripe, but it's not fruit-driven wine). This unusual offering fades long but closed, with hints of spice and coffee. Previous tastings of Mt. Carmel have proved it a tough read when young. Hold and taste in three years.",Mt. Carmel Vineyard,86,35.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Babcock
148508,Australia,"The nose of this Bordeaux-like Cabernet displays strong herb and earth tones. Cassis, earth, dried herb and licorice flavors ride the even, medium-weight palate. The finish is dry, with tart berry and a slight citrus note.",,86,13.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hope Estate
148509,Australia,"Ripe and buttery with tropical fruit and oak on the nose, this Chardonnay has decent mouthfeel and an attractive sweet-tart profile.

148510,US,"A good California Barbera, with medium weight, classic tart cherry flavors offset by leather and herb accents, and zingy, almost sharp acidity. Has good body and mouthfeel, and cries out for hearty food like big pasta dishes or cassoulet.",Barelli Creek Vineyard,86,19.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Barbera,E & J Gallo
148511,France,"Offers a bouquet of pear and anise, plus an earthy floral note. Richer flavors of apple and quince follow, with lime and toast accents. Displays a good acid spine and some class, finishing even and dry. This wine has nice parts.",Premier Cru,86,18.0,Burgundy,Montagny,,,,,Chardonnay,Prosper Maufoux
148512,US,"The nose here delivers a hefty dose of meaty, smoky, nutty notes paired with mild pear and apple. The palate doesn't show complexity—a pronounced toasted oak rides hard on apple and pineapple fruit. It's balanced and finishes dry, but comes up wanting the desired texture and nuance.",The Sculptor Reserve,85,34.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,M. Cosentino
148513,US,"Lean and tautly balanced, this wine has an outdoorsy, mineral-and-hay bouquet and sweet herbal accents. Green apple flavors take over the palate, though hints of lemon and minerals also show up. Tasters didn't find anything terribly wrong here, just a lack of element that would make it more right. Finishes with lingering oaky notes.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,85,30.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
148514,US,"Crème brûlée and baked apple aromas on the nose open to a smooth palate of mild apple, pineapple and spice flavors with citrus accents.The flavors aren't vibrant, though, and the intensity of the oak rendered the faint fruit nearly invisible.",Fournier Vineyard,85,40.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Conn Valley
148515,US,"There's still a good and pleasant dose of pineapple and apple fruit accented by vanilla spice in this wine, but a mature and overly soft palate-feel suggests that it's best consumed near-term. Finishes smooth and light, with medium length. Drink up this year.",Clos des Pierres Reserve,85,45.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Peter McCoy
148516,US,"Opens with a nice nose of roasted nuts, banana, caramel and a hint of smoke. The palate's pear, baked apple and apricot flavors wear interesting coconut accents, but all these are unfortunately overrun by a scotch notes peek out from behind an edgy acidity.",Hyde Vineyard,85,55.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Ramey
148517,Australia,"There's a nice, jammy, berry and herb nose here with a touch of weediness among the fruit and cedar flavors on the palate. Light-to-medium-weight and smootly textured, it has balance, and berry and cocoa flavors. Singing on the nose, even on the palate, it's turns astringent on the back end.",,85,13.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,,,,Merlot,Hope Estate
148518,US,"The deep gold color here suggests age, as do the soft, vaguely oxidized flavors.

Drink now.",Première Cuvée,85,35.0,California,North Yuba,Sierra Foothills,,,,Chardonnay,Renaissance
148519,Italy,"From Apulia, in the Italian heel, a blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Rosso. Long a supermarket favorite, the brand has always been rustic and powerful, but flavorful and inexpensive. Those are still its virtues. Big aromas of wild cherries and tar, with powerful berry flavors, it's dry and clean, the perfect gulp for barbecue.",Riserva,85,9.0,Southern Italy,Salice Salentino,,,,,Red Blend,Taurino
148520,US,"Asian pear, but also dairy-like notes of cheese, sour cream and show on the nose. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy. Apple and woody flavors show on the palate; dry wood and spice mark the back end. A good wine, but now reading ponderously—perhaps past its prime.",Bien Nacido Reserve,84,32.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Bernardus
148521,France,"A crisp nose of stone, lemon and grass opens this clean white made from Burgundy's other legal white grape. It shows nice lemon flavors, a touch of spice and a straightforward finish.

148522,France,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Malbec produced only in good vintages, this year's Verdillac is light but charming.

The finish is bitter and requires rich foods.",Verdillac,84,8.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Armand Roux
148523,US,"Offers an attractive nose of white peach, pear, lime and anise, but fails to come through with much substance on the palate.

148528,US,"This ripe, lush Syrah boldly expresses itself with shiny, saturated colors and bright, spicy, assertive fruit. It's a full-bodied, sappy wine, forward and plump, and the deep core of blackberry fruit is enhanced with pepper, citrus peel, clove and other spices.

148529,US,"Were this from a more prestigious winery it would command a considerably higher price, but evaluated on its own merits it is a stunning success. There is a vivid, broad middle palate of black cherry, cassis and plum; a fine acid structure, and hard, stiff tannins. But there is also an elegant complexity, highlighted with flavors of earth and iron, that comes from the soil.

148603,US,"Smoky and tough-skinned, with loads of espresso and heavy toast hiding black fruit. Cedar and dark chocolate round it out. This is a big, brooding wine that still needs some time to come together despite the late release. A Merlot that should rival many Cabernets for longevity. Cellar Selection.",Howell Mountain,92,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Merlot,Duckhorn
148604,US,"Delivers almost everything you could ask for from a California Merlot. Plenty of plush, opulent fruit (blackberry and currant) and high-quality oak, and it tastes terrific. It has that pinpoint, laser-like quality you find in good wine. It's also very tannic: It numbs the palate and dries out on the finish, so it's best now with rich, fatty meats or age it and let it soften.

148605,US,"Woodward Canyon makes both a Charbonneau white and red; this is a 60/40 Merlot/Cabernet blend from a vineyard in northwest Walla Walla county.

It broadens out in the mouth, with lots of delicious, chocolatey cherry fruit, smooth tannins, and a sweet, lingering finish",Charbonneau,92,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Red Blend,Woodward Canyon
148606,US,"The Horse Heaven vineyard has been producing exceptional Sauvignon Blancs for the past decade. In this unusual vintage, which started very cool and lasted through an extended, late harvest, the grapes ripened to perfection. Ripe, lush fruit gets some added creaminess from barrel fermentation and aging sur lie. There are scents of lime, citrus peel, wet stone and spice, leading to a wonderfully full, focused panoply of flavors in the mouth. The finish goes on forever.

148608,Australia,"The fruit aromas are pretty: plums and black cherries. Add fine oak aromas of smoke, cocoa, vanilla, toast and menthol, and this has all the ingredients to please.

148609,US,"A complex and delicious Bordeaux blend, with a bouquet of blackberries, herbs, tobacco and prunes.

148611,US,"This 3,500-case boutique specializes in Merlot. The Yakima Valley bottling has a fine dark cast to it, and the fruit tends toward black cherry with extra dimensions of coffee, tobacco and smoke. There's a slight hint of earth here, too.

It's very structured and tight now on the palate, with ripe earthy fruit, anise and hay notes still coming together.

148618,US,"Though it has been on the market for some weeks, this wine is wrapped up tight as a drum. Firm fruit suggests black cherry, blackberry and cassis, and it shows underlying streaks of dark, mineral-saturated Red Mountain terroir.

148770,US,"Deeply colored, almost black, with plummy edges, this wine sends out layers of scents: black fruits, coffee, smoke, pencil shavings and ash. I like the confident way it sets up in the mouth, firm but not closed, tannic but not chalky, dark but not bitter. Everything is in balance, and the flavors mingle seamlessly. A wonderful example of the Bordeaux-like qualities that many of the best Washington Cabernets possess.",,90,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wineglass Cellars
148771,US,"Here is a wine with a stellar bouquet, redolent with chocolate-covered cherries, cassis, a bit of “gout de terroir” and other barnyardy stuff best left to the imagination. Complex, lush and ripe, it overwhelms the palate with silky sensations, all wrapped up in smooth chocolate.

148772,US,"Harrison Hill includes a small amount of the second oldest Cabernet Sauvignon plantings in Washington state, which form the backbone of this blended red wine. Merlot (25%) and Cabernet Franc (11%) from the same vineyard complete the mix. Soft, plummy scents, reminiscent of old vine Zinfandel, rise from the glass. Harrison Hill is a cool site, and the grapes are often not harvested until November. The gentle flavors of plums, pie cherries, rose petals and anise reflect the extra hang time. Elegant, light and seductive.",Harrison Hill,90,45.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Red Blend,DeLille
148773,US,"Charbonneau is Woodward Canyon's proprietary name for its white and red blended wines. The blanc is predominantly Sémillon, with 10% Sauvignon Blanc added to round it out. The nose is scented with freshly mown hay, spice and herbs. It has plenty of crisp fruit in the mouth, and a distinctive spiciness that begs to be paired with Thai food,  crab cakes or something with cilantro. Great food wine.",Charbonneau Blanc,90,28.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,White Blend,Woodward Canyon
148774,US,"An intense blue-purple wine, young, grapey and striking. The classic Klipsun core of iron/mineral is there, along with tight, spicy fruit, and plenty of acid for long-term aging.

148775,US,"Apogee is L'Ecole's proprietary Bordeaux blend. This Merlot-dominated (60%) wine also includes about one-third Cabernet Sauvignon and a dash of Cabernet Franc; it shows complex aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon and coffee, with plump, ripe red fruit.

148777,US,"The blend here is 39% Cabernet Sauvignon, 39% Merlot and 22% Cabernet Franc. The wine is dark, dense, what some call “brooding.” It is firm and tart up front, but stuffed with layers of oak and herb and cherry/berry flavor.

In recent years, it has included not only declassified Chaleur Estate, but some extra juice from Harrison Hill as well. It's always a lovely wine, forward, fruit-filled, warm and generous.

148785,US,"The nose jumps from the glass, promising ripe, black cherry and cassis fruit, black pepper spice, and some high-toned “lift.” Round and succulent, it's a deep-colored, still grapey, sweet and lingering wine with nice pepper spice accents. Much more power than the winery's '97, it shows the strengths of the vintage, drinks well right now, and has the stuffing to cellar well for another half decade.",,89,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Canoe Ridge
148786,US,"This is a wine made for the cellar. It's dark, and smells rich, with ripe blackberry and plum fruit and a hefty dose of vanilla-scented, smoky oak.

148853,Argentina,"Full, dense and powerful is this blend of Malbec and Cabernet, but it's also ultraripe and loaded with new oak. Earth, cola and blackberry are all attractive aromas, while the berry fruit is commendable.

148854,Argentina,"Here's a good but rugged blend of Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet that starts out with smoked meat, rubber and pure red-fruit aromas. The feel may seem a touch hard if sipped alone, but with food it will sing a pretty tune. On the finish it's burly and tannic, but it's healthy as can be and should age nicely for several years.

148872,Australia,"The pear, apple and herb aromas and flavors here are almost swamped by the spicy oak.

148873,US,"High-toned blueberry, blackberry and cherry fruit is accented with nuances of herbs and chocolate. This is still tannic, young, grapey and tight; the winery is always one of the first to release their red wines.

Displays fine balance and good acidity, which supports the ripe black-currant fruit, cedar and peppery notes. It's structured rather than plush, and finishes long, dry and toasty.

148879,Australia,"There are no complaints with this Chardonnay. Apple, pineapple, butter and toasted oak load the flavor package. The perfect balance and velvety mouthfeel provide a solid background.

148938,France,"The chalky soil of Maimbray gives this wine its distinct mineral character.

148941,France,"Deiss's 2002 Engelgarten is a firm, dry, minerally wine that ably wraps anise, green apple and citrus fruits in a cloak of austere minerality.

148942,Argentina,"This wine is rock solid and well worth a go. The nose is smoky, rubbery and full of fruit. In the mouth, vanilla softens and supports pure plum and cherry flavors.

Finishes with a tart orange aftertaste.",Ingle Vineyard,88,25.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,,,,Johannisberg Riesling,Heron Hill
148944,Argentina,"Probably this winery's best current release; the nose is forward, spicy, fruity and convincing. Follow that with bright cherry and berry flavors along with a finish that's got medium tannins in support of spice and coffee, and you have a well-priced winner. What affordable red wine was meant to be.",Verano,88,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,,,,Merlot,Gouguenheim Winery

148949,US,"Sassy and stylish white wine from Burgundy's most obscure white grape.

148951,US,"Wineglass Cellars is a boutique producer whose focus has been on red wines; this, notes winemaker David Lowe, is their first Chardonnay that's “serious.” It takes the crisp structure of Washington fruit and adds a healthy dose of new oak, giving it plenty of toast, spice and vanilla.

148952,US,"Some good fruit gives this wine a solid foundation. It's dark and rough, with black cherry and blackberry flavors, along with toasty coffee and some earthy ash.

148953,France,"This is a pretty, rose-colored wine, with an earthy scent of barnyard and light cherry fruit.

This is good, plain, quaffable rosé, but tart and one-dimensional.",Cuvée Brut Rosé,87,34.0,Champagne,Champagne,,,,,Champagne Blend,Devaux
148954,Australia,"Nicely built on a solid red fruit core, the berry, cherry and licorice aromas and flavors here wear a heavy wood cloak that holds the fruit in check a bit too much. It's hard not to feel that the full potential of the fruit has been stymied here. Still, the mouthfeel is good and it finishes with attractive, spicy dry cherry, anise and wood notes. Will appeal more to lovers of lavish oak.",Filsell,87,25.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,,,,Shiraz,Grant Burge
148955,US,"Here is a surprisingly light effort, with soft plum-flavored fruit, and gentle accents of lively, peppery spice. There's a hint of asparagus flavor here too, and the finish drops off very quickly. This is an excellent vineyard, and one wonders if the wine is just at a rather unfortunate, awkward phase of its development.",Seven Hills,87,36.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,,,,Merlot,Andrew Will
148956,US,"Bookwalter has done an exciting turnaround as a new generation takes the reins. This is a vivid, forward, toasty and inviting Cabernet. It shows nice, round fruit and plenty of toasty oak.

148957,US,"The apple, earth and mild tropical fruit aromas, good mouthfeel and apple-pear and caramel flavors are all right on target.

148961,US,"This is a well-made, balanced effort with green apple fruit enhanced with hints of honey and allspice. Still quite young and tight, it is just beginning to soften up and show some nice toasted, roasted nuts in the finish. It isn't quite as intense as the Barrel Fermented Chardonnay from CSM; this is a slightly softer, more approachable wine.",Canoe Ridge Estate Vineyard,87,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Chardonnay,Chateau Ste. Michelle
148962,France,"Devaux makes a yeasty, bubbly, straight-ahead style of Champagne. It's tart and tastes mostly of green apples, with just a faint hint of toast in the finish.

148964,US,"This is a 50/50 blend, made in a fruity, forward style. It smells of green berries and pears, and has an edgy crispness that will set up nicely with food. The finish is a bit astringent, dusty, herbaceous, and suggests fresh spices and new-mown hay.

148966,US,"Hogue emphasizes the fruit in their white wines, and this lip-smacking Gewürz is a good example of their style.

Best Buy.",,87,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Gewürztraminer,Hogue
148967,France,"Firm, structured wine which at present tastes young and rather unfocused. It is certainly rich and should develop well. The wood element is dominant at the end, but the fruit should come through to sustain it. The wine needs aging.",Vaudsir,87,,Burgundy,Chablis,,,,,Chardonnay,Joseph Drouhin
148968,US,"Seems a little leaner and more compact than DiStefano's other '98s.

148969,Australia,"Here's one of the bigger Chards of the year. Explodes with aromas of butterscotch, caramel, vanilla, and, oh yes, tropical fruits. The flavors are mouth-filling and rich, like a sweet, custardy, creamy, tangerine-flavored dessert, yet it's dry. However, it loses a few points for being too big and aggressive without the necessary balance. It's awkward.",Giant's Creek,87,17.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,,,,Chardonnay,Rosemount
148970,US,"Bright berries are all dressed up in cedary, pencil-like oak and kissed with velvety black-tea and creamy chocolate notes that linger through the finish.

148971,US,"A little more full-bodied than Royal Oaks's regular bottling, it also has black-cherry notes, but it's also earthier—and oakier, too—with currents of vanilla and dark chocolate. Still has a bite of acidity, which stings the palate, and demands food.",Westerly Vineyard,87,25.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,,,,Merlot,Royal Oaks
148972,US,"A fig, herb and grapefruit bouquet sets the stage.

148973,Australia,"An overripe quality to the blackberry-liqueur fruit, especially on the nose, marks this lovable sweet jam-fest.

148974,France,"The well-defined bright lime and mineral aromas and light peach-pear flavors ride a fine acid backbone.

148976,US,"Though it's an Oregon winery, the vineyard is in Washington's Columbia Valley. It's value-priced and soundly made, with ripe cherries leading off a chocolate and coffee nose.

148979,Australia,"Full, dark berry aromas and a slight mint note open this very friendly, ready-to-drink-tonight Shiraz.

148981,Argentina,"Starts with apple covered in oak-based caramel and vanilla, but loses its focus as it evolves.

149023,France,"Creamy aromas and layers of almonds, toast and spice make this a fascinating wine that continues to reveal new characters. This is the main white from Vacheron, and the intensity of its fruit comes from the almost biodynamic way in which the family's 98-acre vineyard is cultivated. Imported by North Berkeley Imports.",,87,27.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Vacheron
149024,US,"Very soft and buttery, made in a style sure to reach out to a broad base of consumers looking for accessible flavors with lots of oak and tropical fruit. The style feels more Australian than Washington, but it fits in nicely with the winery's expanding lineup of single-vineyard and reserve Chardonnays.",,87,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Chardonnay,Chateau Ste. Michelle
149025,France,"From mainly chalky soil, this wine, made from 15-year-old vines, has an immediately attractive mineral character. There are notes of pear skin and green apples, and a pure, fresh, crisp streak. The fruit shows a great clean, fresh aftertaste. Imported by Bayfield Importing Ltd.",Les Grands Champs,87,,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Fouassier
149026,US,"Very dry and full-bodied, with gritty tannins that cry out for grilled meats, cheeses and olive oil. It's rustic, but refined rustic, and a great value.",Red,87,14.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Malbec,Hey Mambo
149027,US,"From a tiny vineyard in St. Helena, a soft, superripe, extracted Cab whose currant and cherry flavors are so fruity, they veer into chocolate fudge. The wine is dry, with supportive tannins.",Bisou,87,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,James Johnson
149028,France,"This is big in all senses. It has dense, very rich, very powerful fruit and as a consequence of that, it has 14.5% alcohol. It's finely perfumed, with black and violet flavors and aromas, and some good, spicy flavors.",,87,23.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Côtes du Roussillon Villages,,,,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Hecht & Bannier
149029,US,"Polished and ripe, this wine has a gentle, soft mouthfeel that sports red and black cherry, mocha and blackberry flavors. Despite the gentleness, there are firm tannins that cry out for a broiled steak. Best now through 2007.",,87,45.0,California,Napa,,,,,Merlot,Barnett
149030,Australia,"The Prelude Vineyards Chard typically seems a soft-edged, full wine to me—this year it's even more so. Floral and pear aromas lead to more tropical, toasty flavors of nut and plantain. Acid hounds will want more zing, but this will satisfy most everyone else. Imported by Old Bridge Cellars.",Prelude Vineyards,87,29.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,,,,Chardonnay,Leeuwin Estate
149031,US,"From the Pisoni family, a crisp, fruity Chard that's long and deep in jammy apricot, lemon drop and guava flavors that are set off by high acids. This is a big, in-your-face wine, but it has some fine complexities.",,87,35.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Lucia

149033,US,"Kudos to winemaker Adam Suprenant, a New York native, who has done a lot with reds here, even the difficult Cabernet Franc. This version has developed aromas of mushroom, balsam, and chocolate shading plenty of dark berry. Cherry-berry flavors are edged with mushroom, while the smooth tannins meld nicely with moderate acidity. This wine should be enjoyed now and over the next two years.",,87,18.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,,,,Cabernet Franc,Osprey's Dominion
149034,Austria,"Seems a bit on the simple side, but still manages to pack in bright lime flavors and a steely, minerally intensity that lingers on the finish. Crisp and clean on the finish, ending with lemon-lime notes.",Steinriegl Federspiel,87,28.0,Wachau,,,,,,Riesling,Prager

149037,France,"In 2003, Schlumberger only bottled one grand cru Riesling, leaving the fruit from Saering and Kessler to help beef up this wine. It's a plump yet minerally take on Riesling, with lime, apple and melon aromas and flavors accented by a dry, minerally feel. Picks up a hint of anise on the finish.",Les Princes Abbés,87,20.0,Alsace,Alsace,,,,,Riesling,Domaines Schlumberger
149038,Argentina,"Round, ripe and showing no cracks, although there is a touch of dill weed on the nose that's not altogether unwelcome.

149039,Australia,"Like other Philip Shaw wines, this one has an ethereal quality to it that could be understood as elegant by one person and just too delicate by another.

Imported by Cumulus Wines Inc.",,87,17.0,New South Wales,Orange,,,,,Chardonnay,Climbing
149040,US,"This medium-weight Sauvignon Blanc opens with citrus and mild vanilla aromas. Rich on the palate, it's 100% barrel fermented and contains 5% Chardonnay, but does not undergo malolactic fermentation.

Drink now.",,87,12.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Lockwood
149041,Australia,"This is an interesting Chardonnay for what it's not: not a blockbuster in terms of fruit, not overwhelming in oak, not an overly sweet puppy, not cheesy and thick from massive lees contact. Instead, it's balanced, one might almost say refined. Don't look for nuances, just enjoy it for what it is.",,87,13.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,,,,Chardonnay,Heritage Road
149042,US,"Salmon pink in color, this starts with a burst of raspberry cream and vanilla aromas, and turns rich and creamy on the palate.

Closes with an ultraclean finish.",Brut Rosé,87,13.0,California,California,California Other,,,,Champagne Blend,Korbel

149044,Germany,"Here's a racy Riesling that won't break your budget.

149046,US,"The name honors one of the founders of the original winery, and the wine generally mixes buttery fruit with a blast of oak flavor. It's burly, bold and aggressive; subtlety is not its strong suit.

149047,Australia,"From the outset to the long finish, there's a lot to like in this sweet jammy Shiraz. Berry, cherry, chocolate and a touch of cassis abound.

A killer barbecue red, anything not too complicated on the grill would be a good match.",Bin 2000,86,10.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Shiraz,McGuigan
149048,US,"Here is a classic Klipsun nose, scented with dark streaks of metal and earth. The dark, mineral notes are not yet integrated with the fruit, which is high-toned and earthy, with some barnyard flavors. The tannins are rough and rustic, and give the impression that the wine needs more time to smooth out.",Klipsun Vineyard,86,29.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,,,,Merlot,Wilridge

149050,Australia,"A bright pear and cinnamon nose opens this attractive, medium-weight wine. The palate shows peach and pear flavors, supported by brisk—some might say sharp—acidity, but flabby it isn't. Shows good balance and a nice long spicy finish, where the oak comes on strong.",Barrel Fermented,86,12.0,South Australia,South Australia,,,,,Chardonnay,Wolf Blass
149051,US,"A warm microclimate means that reds from Carmel Valley are typically less herbal than those from other portions of Monterey. This wine boasts a nice mix of cedar and black cherries upfront before turning tough, with a bitter edge to the tannins on the finish. Drink it young, with food to tame its rough edges.",Heller Estate,86,26.0,California,Carmel Valley,Central Coast,,,,Merlot,Durney
149052,US,"Columbia Crest always does a fine job with this budget grape. The accent is on green-apple and green-berry fruit, with suggestions of herb and spice filling in the flavor interest. It's a high acid, food-ready wine that will accompany a wide variety of shellfish, oily steakfish and some cream-sauced pastas.",,86,9.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Sémillon,Columbia Crest
149053,US,"There's plenty of peachy punch to this off-dry Riesling, fresh off the excellent 2000 vintage in the Columbia Valley. It's meant to be served chilled—a good idea, which emphasizes the acids and takes the sweet edge off. Flavors of orange candy dominate the finish.",,86,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Johannisberg Riesling,Hogue
149054,US,"Melange is Waterbrook's blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (41%), Merlot (32%), Sangiovese (14%) and Cabernet Franc (13%), and it's a lot of wine for the price. There's plenty of rich cassis/berry fruit, lots of toasty oak, and a beefy, firm weight to the wine that speaks of power. On the downside, there is some stemminess, tough tannins and a green flavor to the finish.",Mélange,86,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Red Blend,Waterbrook
149055,Australia,"Mainstream Chardonnay has been a mainstay for this dependable and recently-merged-with-Southcorp family enterprise. The orange and mild tropical fruit bouquet has just a kiss of oak, and some mild spice notes enter on the palate. The even mouthfeel and just slightly tangy finish keep this lightly sweet and sour, round—but not mushy—wine right on target.",Estate Bottled,86,10.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,,,,Chardonnay,Rosemount
149056,US,"The aromas are herbal, flirting dangerously with green pepper before eventually settling somewhere between oregano and tea.

149060,US,"Preston releases their red wines relatively late, and the extra time in barrel and bottle softens the tannins, and gives the finished wines a rounded quality. This is a solid effort, true to varietal, with plummy fruit, good balance, and a nice chocolatey, toasty finish that has just a slight taste of bitter banana to it. Good, serviceable Merlot at a fair price.",,86,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Merlot,Preston
149061,France,"This introduction to white Burgundy derives from sources in Puligny and Meursault. A bouquet of hay, earth, liqueur and even some green tobacco aromas opens to a palate of ripe pear and mineral flavors. Evenly textured, the wine is round but not fat. Finishes crisp and dry, with decent length. Drink now.",Les Sétilles,86,15.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne,,,,,Chardonnay,Olivier Leflaive
149062,Australia,"A product of organic viticulture and American oak, the wine's scent and flavor are mainly blackberry with touches of chocolate, smoke and spice. The palate experience is good except for some unresolved coarse tannins. This is a solid Shiraz that needs just a little more time.",,86,28.0,Victoria,Bendigo,,,,,Shiraz,Passing Clouds
149063,Australia,"This solid mainstream offering sports plenty of cherry and tart berry aromas and flavors wrapped in a toasty cocoon.

149065,US,"Columbia Crest makes three Chardonnays, of which this is the least expensive. It boasts assertive, somewhat herbaceous aromas of peach and spice; the fruit is clean, forward and zesty. It displays a lot of character in a vivid style that showcases Washington's  intense fruit and lip-smacking acids.",,86,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,,,,Chardonnay,Columbia Crest
149066,US,"Smells sharp and weedy, with aromas of green stems and chlorophyll that are softened by a hint of blackberry. It's also a tannic wine, the kind that makes the tongue stick to the palate. Copious oak attempts to further soften the wine and adds a creamy lushness.",,86,25.0,California,Solano County,North Coast,,,,Merlot,St. Francis
149067,US,"Notes of chocolate, blackberry and plum, and a waft of French oak that adds vanilla and clove aromas. It's hard to imagine prettier tannins, at once soft and luxurious. Call it a fine example from a light vintage.",,86,31.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Merlot,Stags' Leap Winery

149069,US,"A woody wine that features a shell of toasty, cedary oak over a core of black-cherry fruit.

149073,Argentina,"Good color but the nose and palate don't offer that Cabernet lushness that most of us seek. The red-fruit nose is kind of lean, probably a reflection of Patagonia's cool climate.

149113,Australia,"This Adelaide Hills Riesling has lively acidity and pretty talc-dust aromas. Its mineral and pannacotta flavors are delicate, and would ideally be a little more concentrated.

149114,US,"Strong new barrel flavors, surprising in a wine at this price, send up a lot of butterscotch and caramel over light cherry and plum flavors.

149157,US,"A heavy cloak of oak can't hide the high alcohol level (15%). Sure, the alcohol provides weight and texture, but also heat on the finish.

It's rich and unctuous on the palate, balancing its considerable residual sugar with only 7% alcohol and crisp, mouthwatering acids. Blends a mélange of fruit—apricots, peaches, pears and apples—with nuances of spice and mineral that no other country in the wine-producing world has yet matched.

149241,New Zealand,"Intense dried-apricot aromas and flavors indicate a high degree of botrytis, which would be overwhelming except for the trademark New Zealand acidity.

149249,New Zealand,"Despite 60% new oak, the first thing you notice about this wine is its gorgeously pure black-cherry fruit.

149281,US,"Peter Rosback's old-vine Zin is always dark and dense and unabashedly alcoholic (15.8%). In this vintage more herbal flavors dominate, along with olives, dates, figs and a decidedly salty note. Unique and not for everyone, but absolutely exceptional.",Old Vine,93,36.0,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Oregon Other,,,,Zinfandel,Sineann
149282,US,"There's plenty of toast for the new-oakies, but it's wrapped around lovely raspberry and plum fruit. Light notes of mint and leather add interest; the wine resonates nicely and gently fades rather than falling off a cliff. Not as massively ripe as the 2003, but equally fine.",Meredith Mitchell Vineyard,93,39.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,,,,Pinot Noir,Raptor Ridge
149283,France,"A huge, opulent wine that packs sweet, rich tannins and spicy fruit. In the midst of all this decadence, though, is a kernel of tannic dryness.

149284,US,"There's a baked, roti quality to the aroma of this wine, suggesting the crust of a fresh cherry pie, with the cherry filling flavors accented by vanilla and cinnamon and even a drizzle of crème de cassis. It's a very decadent beverage. Who could have dreamed California Pinot could taste this good? On the other hand, the very size will intimidate chefs. Where is this monster style of Pinot Noir going?

149285,US,"From one of the highest vineyards in the Sonoma Mayacamas comes this profoundly structured, deeply tannic Cab, which also is quite oaky.

149286,US,"This biodynamically farmed vineyard gives great fruit. Here it is detailed with a full range of floral aromas, candied red fruits, hints of cinnamon and plenty of balancing tannins.

149287,US,"Made from Viognier and Roussanne, this intensely sweet wine has rich flavors of the ripest apricots and white peaches, drizzled with vanilla and cinnamon spice. The texture can only be described as voluptuous. Acidity is good, providing a cleansing balance. The alcohol is a very high 18 percent. This is sheer decadence.",ReZerve White Port,93,17.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,,,,White Blend,Shenandoah
149288,US,"This biodynamically farmed vineyard delivers stunning, elegant, textured Pinot.

149291,US,"Ladera has been producing ageworthy Cabernets for the last few years and this is surely one. As rich and dense in tannins as it is, it's shockingly forward in blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, while a plethora of new French oak adds even more sweetness.

149292,US,"This terroir-driven Pinot, from the Oregon side of the Columbia River, shows a dramatically different profile than the Willamette Valley Pinots commonly associated with the state. Kudos to winemaker Peter Rosback for finding great Pinot all over Oregon. This unique vineyard shows classic varietal fruit laced with mineral, kissed with toast, and finished with delicious mocha flavors from new oak barrels.

149301,France,"The Cuvelier family of Léoville-Poyferré owns this property. The wine shows in the dense, ripe fruit, with dusty tannins and concentration.

149309,US,"Here's one mighty fine and interesting Zin. It has the smoothness of a great red wine, with a rich, fruity complexity that lasts through a long finish.

149311,New Zealand,"Intense and extracted, this wine has strong cola, chocolate, black-cherry, cinnamon and peppermint aromas that border on eccentric and over-the-top, yet somehow stay in balance.

149448,Argentina,"Aggressive and oaky, with lactic aromas as well as heavy burnt-toast notes. This is Trapiche's flagship blend of Cabernet and Malbec, and every year it seems less than up to its price. The '03 version is tart in the middle, with a ton of tannin and raw wood.

149498,US,"A remarkably intense wine from vineyards located in the western hills of Salinas Valley. Made with grapes ripened enough to veer it into tropical fruit territory, but those telltale Monterey acids are bright as a bell. A solid dose of oak lends smoky vanilla and spice components.

149500,US,"One of a growing family of California whites that marry unrelated varietals, this is a rich, complex and delightful example, with a menagerie of flavors. The blending of Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier yields everything from apples, peaches and grapefruit to flowers and honey. Slightly sweet, though protected by a racy acidity. The result is a lot of fun. But because the flavors are strong, it's best matched with the right foods.

149528,Argentina,"Not sure why this 1999 would still be on the market as a current release, but at the very least it shows that Malbec ages fairly well.

149535,Australia,Made by the Davey family—the folks who make Shingleback—this Semillon-Chardonnay blend is a fun wine.

149541,Argentina,"Why this vintage is so much more monotone and raisiny than the lovely '02 is anyone's guess. However, that's the case. The nose starts out with game and bacon but it shifts to raisin and prune with airing. The palate, meanwhile, is also lively at first and then goes raisiny.

149695,US,"Super-ripe grapes put their shoulder to the wheel for a highly extracted wine characterized by masses of peach and pear flavors. Oak contributes added spice, vanilla and smoke.

149696,US,"Very pale in color, just beyond rose. Wonderfully fragrant aromas of black cherries, cola, Oriental spices, smoke and mushroomy earth.

149698,US,"A juicy, delicious wine; the best Atlas Peak Sangiovese so far. It's got pronounced berry-fruit flavors, with a peppery, spicy component and a rich earthiness.

Finishes with just a slight hit of tannins.",,87,16.0,California,Atlas Peak,Napa,,,,Sangiovese,Atlas Peak
149699,New Zealand,"Rich cassis and chocolate aromas and flavors are offset by wisps of green bell pepper that comes and goes—one sniff it's there, the next it's not.

149736,New Zealand,"A soft, gentle style of Sauvignon Blanc, with gooseberry and nectarine fruit that seems almost creamy across the palate.

149742,New Zealand,"Black cherries, dried herbs and a hint of toast make for a flavorful mouthful. Fleshy without being soft, thanks to vibrant acidity that will cut through rich meat dishes.

149743,US,"One of those wines that smells so good, you could just sniff and swirl. There's lemongrass, vanilla, spearmint, butter and toast and a honeyed sweetness.

149801,US,"From a winery that doesn't ever seem to do anything wrong comes this fine, almost complex wine. It would probably be fantastic from a better vintage.

149860,New Zealand,"Starts off well, with aromas of toast, vanilla and black cherries. The attack is rich and sweet as well, but then the wine turns a bit drying and herbal on the finish. Needs time—but will the fruit hold?",Gimblett,86,35.0,Hawke's Bay,,,,,,Merlot,Trinity Hill
149861,New Zealand,"A solid offering, with bright cherry fruit that's marked by herb notes. There's more oak evident on the palate, as flavors of vanilla and cream sneak up on you. Very soft tannins make this a wine to drink now, not to age.",Drylands,86,,Marlborough,,,,,,Merlot,Selaks

149863,US,"Definitely comes down on the gamy side, with an aroma of bacon or sweaty saddle wafting over black raspberry fruit. Oak adds vanilla and charred-smoky elements.

149864,New Zealand,"The Corbans house style seems to de-emphasizes the ultrapungent elements of Sauvignon Blanc, focusing instead on grapefruit and, in this case, white nectarine. It's a delicate wine that goes down easy.",Winemaker's Selection,85,13.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Corbans
149865,US,"Anything remotely resembling true Chardonnay at this price is rare, but here's one that succeeds, if at the most elemental level. It's got proper apple and peach fruit and the requisite amount of vanilla-tinged oak, although probably not from new French barrels. It's a tiny bit sweet, but hey, that's the way people like it. And it's very clean. All of which makes it a great value in   Chardonnay.",,85,6.0,California,California,California Other,,,,Chardonnay,Coastal Ridge

149871,US,"Lees and oak dominate the nose of this very ripe wine. The result is size: A big, rich, oaky, fruity quaff, it fills the mouth with flavors and palate impressions.

It's a good basic red and will have wide appeal with its round, supple mouthfeel. Generally a workaday, inexpensive Italian red, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is a good pizza/pasta choice.

149877,New Zealand,"A semi-dry bottling that's almost fat. Ripe peaches are center-stage, ushered in by a minty-herbal edge and out by gentle lime notes.

149892,US,"I liked the winery's 2001, although it was quite tannic, but this isn't in the same league. This vintage is also numbingly tannic, maybe even more so, but the core of fruit that charmed a year ago isn't there, leading to questions about ageability.

This one does its best, with modest aromas of black-cherry fruit accentuated by oak, but there's a green weediness throughout that age will not soften.

149938,US,"From a winery in the heart of Napa that has long been overshadowed by flashier competitors. Maybe this wine shows why.

149945,France,"First you notice the new wood flavors and aromas, then you see the name of the consultant, Michel Rolland. This is definitely a modern,  polished wine that has lost some of its true Bordeaux character, but has certainly gained in depth and richness.

149946,Chile,"In tasting this vintage for the second time, we found better balance than originally but still we encountered dull fruit, a lot of earthiness and leather, and some pickle barrel.

149948,US,"This Mendocino region has some very old Syrah vines, and they have produced a dark, soft, lush Syrah, with an earthy component to the blackberry and mocha flavors.

149949,US,"Released at four-plus years, unusual for a Merlot, but the tannins are beginning to melt, although they're still formidable.

149950,US,"This is Brander's best Cabernet yet. That's mainly due to ripeness. They achieved delicious blackberry, black currant and mocha flavors that echo the best of the North Coast.

149965,US,"Tough, dry and tannic, with an unrelieved quality, this is a wine that needs serious time in the cellar or major decanting to let it soften.

Best now.",Palazzio,87,34.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
150030,New Zealand,"Pleasant enough, but the lime and grapefruit flavors are a bit dilute. Lacks intensity overall; well chilled, the mild flavors would make a nice counterpoint to strongly flavored foods.",Winemaker's Private Bin,83,18.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Corbans
150031,US,"Has some real varietal Cabernet notes of currant and blackberry, with oaky nuances. It's supple and well-made, although of average quality, and a bit thin in the mid-palate. But it's dry and clean.",,83,8.0,California,North Coast,North Coast,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dunnewood

150033,New Zealand,"Another N.Z. Pinot that smells better than it tastes: attractive toast, black-cherry and cola aromas give way to lean flavors of tart berries and a persistent green tannic edge that seems unlikely to fade; drink it soon.",,83,15.0,Marlborough,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Stoneleigh
150034,US,"Pleasant enough and Chard-like, with aromas of tangerine, peach and a kiss of honeyed oak. It's got enough residual sugar to almost fall into the off-dry category. Well made and certainly affordable.",,83,9.0,California,California,California Other,,,,Chardonnay,Woodbridge

150038,US,"The cherry and smoke aromas wear an attractive olive-herb note, but the fruit could use more weight and definition. Feels like many Merlots, with its very soft, plummy mouthfeel, although the flavor range is darker, showing more blackberry and cassis.

150046,US,"Inexpensive Cabernet can often be slightly weedy, even rubbery, with a hot feeling to it. So it is with this wine.

150060,US,"Although it's less pricey than the winery's Encell Pinot, I slightly prefer this one for its accessibility.

150287,US,"At over five years of age, this wine still boasts an impressively saturated purple color and dense, rich black-fruit aromas. There's plenty of oak, too. But the tannins are dry and hard; this wine's future development is unclear. Impressive more than pleasurable, and might always stay that way.",,87,35.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pellegrini Vineyards
150288,Italy,"Dark is the word here, with lots of deep toast, licorice, chocolate and coffee notes throughout.

150289,US,"Weedy, with some bell pepper and herb aromas, cassis and tobacco. Elegantly lean and graceful in the mouth, the wine ends in a long, spicy finish.

150290,Italy,"This smooth, balanced offering shows plenty of cherry, leather and cedar flavors. The round mouthfeel and the licorice and toast flavors on the palate are wrapped around ripe, almost candied fruit. Oak is present but there's enough fruit to support it. A likeable wine to drink now.",,87,15.0,Tuscany,Chianti Superiore,,,,,Sangiovese,Burchino
150291,Italy,"This medium weight wine shows complex dark plum, toast, tar and cocoa notes, but there is also a decidedly sauvage element, and this gamy note won't appeal to all tasters. Dense black-cherry, plum and licorice flavors, brisk acidity and full, ripe tannins round out the package. Has impressive qualities, but also controversial ones. Cellar until 2005.",Tenute Marchese Antinori Riserva,87,38.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,,,,Sangiovese,Antinori
150292,Italy,"A bouquet of saddle leather, cherry and rhubarb opens to a richly textured palate of sour cherries and dry spice accents.

150293,Italy,"Opaque and ultra toasty, this very international-style Chianti has “black” aromas and flavors, nice texture and a long espresso-and-dark-chocolate finish. It's solid, but really reads deep only in one dimension—the heavy oak regime.

150295,Italy,"Rustic in a positive sense, this medium-weight, supple wine shows dark cherry fruit once a touch of sulfur blows off. Finishes long, with black-cherry, licorice and espresso flavors.

150299,Italy,"Very big and dark, the deep cherry fruit here is cloaked—some might say overshadowed—by the intensity of the oak.

Black currant, herb, tea, oak, vanilla, maple, anise, blueberries and more--it could be an excercise in overkill, if all the parts weren't in such fine harmony. Really big, but with excellent balance, this reveals much less now than the RWT. It is everything a flagship wine in its infancy should be--immaculate component parts, superbly full on the palate, possessed of great length and incredible potential. An absolute keeper to visit in 7, 15 or 25 years. To be released 5/01.",Grange,96,185.0,South Australia,South Australia,,,,,Shiraz,Penfolds
150563,Australia,"Seamless luxury from stem to stern, this ‘baby Grange' is  impressive juice. Blackberry, menthol and smoke play unusually elegantly on the nose, the texture is velvet on the tongue with dark berry, coffee, licorice and muted black pepper flavors. The superb, very long finish combines all the elements with wonderful finesse and a rare grace. Not inexpensive, but fairly priced; you could pay twice as much for half the wine, almost any day in any fine wine store in the country.

150564,France,"A voluptuous blockbuster in the style we are becoming accustomed to from über-consultant Michel Rolland: big, deeply fruited (black cherries) and plush, with elegantly etched spice shadings from new oak.

150565,US,"A juicy, jammy, alcoholic style, tannic and young. This is gutsy, high-toned wine, with fat, extracted fruit. Very dry tannins, good balance.

150566,South Africa,"This big boy greets us with his deep ruby/black cloak. Loaded with cassis from start to finish, there is tremendous fruit depth here and a full, supple mouthfeel.

Enticing, enchanting wine.",Eagle Point Ranch,93,20.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,,,,Zinfandel,Claudia Springs
150568,US,"A blast of spice, mint, bramble and pepper explodes from the glass. The wine is dense, dark, deep and mysterious; the flavors pungent, penetrating and persistent.

150569,US,"There's a lovely sweetness to the fruit, which tastes like ripe, just-picked blackberries. Old vines, 100+ years, deliver sweet, supple, sexy fruit. The wine has very dry tannins, and it might profit from some blending, but with a vineyard this special you have to admire the single-vineyard approach.",Live Oak Vineyard,93,28.0,California,Contra Costa County,Central Coast,,,,Zinfandel,Cline
150570,Australia,"The rich blackberry, vanilla and toast nose sets you up for a lush, supple wine and this one does not disappoint. Full and dense, it offers rich black-cherry and cassis flavors on the palate, and a huge finish with fine-grained tannins. Very well poised for its size, it's approachable now. Nevertheless, it will be much more nuanced and show more finesse in 5–8 years. Keep for a decade or two, maybe more.

150600,US,"Good color, tight, firm fruit, with some heft to it. There's cassis as well as cherry, and the wine has the weight of a Sonoma Zin, with good acids to give it lift.

150605,US,"All the components of fine Zinfandel are in top form here, from the opening fat, dark berry aromas to the deep, sweet fruit on the smoothly textured palate and the lovely fruit-acid balance. Closes handsomely, with full even tannins and some white pepper on the long back end.

150606,US,"Lovely nose, with coconut and hazelnut scents augmenting the cherry/berry fruit. Not an ordinairy set of scents and flavors, but enticing and distinctive. The fruit is intense and perfumed, and the accents of coconut seem just right.",Clockspring,90,18.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,,,,Zinfandel,Milliaire
150607,Australia,"Comes on full and lush from the opening, with blackberry, chocolate, menthol and smoke aromas. In the mouth it delivers dark, dry flavors of plum, cassis and toasty oak and has good acidity that keeps it from getting mushy. The solid finish offers more of the same, a nice spiciness and some substantial tannins. Drink now; should be even better in two years.",Bin 128,90,22.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,,,,Shiraz,Penfolds

150613,Canada,"Inniskillin continues to push the boundaries of icewine, as evidenced by this wood-aged Vidal. The vanilla and spice of oak barrels partially masks some of the stranger Vidal aromas, allowing the apricot and peach scents to come to the fore.

150616,US,"A blend of Peachy Canyon Estate (67%) and Mustang Springs Ranch (33%) fruit. In this vintage the Peachy Zins seem to lack intensity, but this is a well-balanced effort that shows the best of what is there.

150618,US,"There's some old-vine juice included in the blend, and it shows.

150619,US,"Herbs and spices dominate the nose, and the wine has an intriguing blend of 9% Petite Sirah, 2% Grenache and 2% Mourvèdre in it.

150621,Australia,"Made for almost 40 years—since 1962—this edition of 389 sports lots of spicy American oak, and displays black fruit and tobacco aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is big, the texture rich and the full, spicy finish is long and tannic. It's drinkable now, but really needs a few years to unwrap a bit, and the oak mantle will probably always be heavy. Satisfying, though somewhat one-dimensional.",Bin 389,89,19.0,Australia Other,Australia,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Penfolds
150622,US,"Nice cherry fruit, in a big, bold, forward, friendly style. The fruit is perfectly ripened, balanced, full and nicely handled, with nothing obscuring the clean, ripe flavors.

150625,US,"This wine strikes a perfect balance, showing the jammy, slightly raisiny ripeness of Paso Robles fruit, but keeping enough acid in the mix to buoy it up.

150626,US,"Orange, apricot and pineapple aromas ride over a deep bass note of earth and spice.

Could use a touch more acidity to really make the flavors sing.",Ice Wine,89,18.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,,,,Riesling,Wagner
150627,Canada,"Wow, is this sweet—tooth-achingly sweet. The aromas and flavors are relatively pure and free of botrytis; instead you get boatloads of ripe pear and melon flavors, huge thickness and weight, and decent acidity. Almost too rich and sweet for its own good.",Ice Wine,88,50.0,Ontario,Niagara Peninsula,,,,,Riesling,Cave Spring

150633,France,"The dark color tells you right away this is no ordinary vin de pays. Then you sniff it and get cedar, black currants and blackberries. The finish has juicy acidity and dusty tannins, suggesting a couple years' cellaring may be warranted. Impressive.",,88,14.0,Rhône Valley,Vin de Pays du Gard,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Mas de Guiot
150634,Australia,"A round, ripe pear and lemon nose opens this medium-weight, full flavored white.

150637,US,"Inky, opaque and tight, this wine offers a bouquet of black fruits and toast. Though the mouthfeel is full and supple, it is presently very closed and yields scant flavor definition beyond the presence of a very good depth of dark fruits and well-charred oak. Finishes dry, with somewhat more discernable blackberry and vanilla notes and moderately puckering tannins. Best for keeping; try in two-plus years.",St. Peter's Church Vineyard,88,40.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
150638,US,"The ripe berry flavors wear a veil of deeply toasted oak in this smooth and supple wine, but does it with finesse.

150643,South Africa,"The earth, smoke, saddle-leather aromas and flavors are powerful and distinctive but probably not to all tastes. The lavish high-toast oak is nearly over-the-top, but a creamy mouthfeel and long finish tip the scales to the pleasure side. Complex and challenging … but not for those averse to the elements mentioned.",Kevin Arnold,88,30.0,Stellenbosch,,,,,,Shiraz,Waterford
150644,Canada,"Vidal has a peculiar bouquet that I have a hard time describing. This one boasts muskmelon, litchi and kumquat aromas, backed by a honeyed sweetness and grapefruit-like acids.

150648,US,"High toned, alcoholic nose, with cherry nail-polish scents. Cherries and plums fill the mouth, along with tongue-lashing tannins.

150649,US,"Old vines from Russian River and Alexander valleys go into this spicy, briary, gamy Zin. There's a dark undercurrent of tar, pipe tobacco and smoke that runs through the finish.

150650,Australia,"This solid red has deep currant and toasty oak aromas. It opens to rich dark berry, plum and leather flavors with Asian spice accents.

150652,US,"A fair amount of the cuvee is from the 130-year-old Grandpère vineyard, which lends a soft, herbal, grassy undertone to the wine.

150655,US,"Full, forward, fleshy nose shows lots of bright, spicy fruit.

150657,France,"Impressive dark purple in color, this powerful vin carries lots of toasted-oak aromas: menthol and cedar in particular. There's some promising dark fruit underneath it all that should emerge in a couple years' time.

150664,US,"Even and smooth, this Paso Robles contender comes on strong with round, jammy red berry and rhubarb fruit offset by pepper and dusty rose accents.

150680,US,"Blueberry, spices, fruitcake, even a maple syrup note mark the nose of this fairly sweet Zinfandel.

150731,France,"From a vintage known for its readily-approachable wines, this grand cru Saint-Emilion shows surprising structure. Some toasty oak frames delicate black-cherry fruit.

150734,Italy,"Brisk acidity and a lean but smooth profile characterize this taut, somewhat tart wine.  A very inviting vouquet with cherry, cinnamon, clove, cedar, and tobacco notes sets a pretty stage for the palate, but after the great setup the wine delivers rather uninspired and predictable tart berry and sour cherry Barbera flavors.

150762,US,"This wine is still young and precocious, but don't judge it too quickly. Let it air in your glass, and watch how it changes. One minute it's all cherries and smoke; the next it heaves up a great draught of currants, cocoa and cedar.

150764,US,"Specially selected lots account for this top-of-the-line bottling. It's really very good. The fruit tends toward raspberries and cherries, and it's smooth as silk in the mouth. The nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon and peppery notes last for a long time on the finish. The difference between this and the typical Carneros bottling is intensity; the fruit is more focused.

150770,US,"Somehow, this fine winery gets left off a lot of “best of” lists, which makes it a great value, especially from a super vintage like ‘97. This is serious Napa Cabernet, filled with fancy black currant, cassis and mocha, and complex with toasty oak. It's very dry and elegant, one of those wines that fills the palate with the most sumptuous flavors and textures.

150771,Chile,"From Robert Mondavi and Eduardo Chadwick, a Chilean producer (Errázuriz), this wine is a blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Carmenère. The color is inky dark, and it smells young and intense, almost fiery—there's a suggestion of charcoal and embers. Massive fruit explodes in the mouth, but it's not a fruit bomb; it's much too sophisticated for that. Oak is fancy but not pronounced. Its aging timeline should be similar to that of a great Bordeaux.",,92,60.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Seña

Good stuff.",,91,25.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,,,,Pinot Blanc,Etude
150774,US,"A very distinctive Chard—full of character and even eccentricity. There are strong, up-front aromas of tangerines, vanilla, butterscotch, smoke, ripe peaches and caramel.

150777,US,"One of the first ‘99 Pinots to come out, this puppy from the Napa side of the American Viticultural Area is young and promising. It shows classic notes of plum, sautéed mushroom, vanilla and smoke, and something earthy, midway between chocolate and leather. The aroma is deep; you can inhale it and feel it in your head. Also heady are the flavors, which are sumptuous, rich and complex, with plenty of fruit and spice, very dry and velvety.

150781,Chile,"A blend of old-vine Cariñena (60%), Syrah (25%) and Merlot (15%). The color is impressively dark and so is the fruit—mainly plums and blackberries. Toast and dried spices from new oak give an additional impression of opulence. But even more impressive is the balance. This is no low-acid, fruit-and-oak wonder; the natural acidity of the Carignane shines through, giving lift and definition to the flavors. Easy to drink now, but should easily hold a few years.",Cordillera,91,26.0,Curicó Valley,,,,,,Red Blend,Miguel Torres
150782,US,"The workhorse wine from this Pinot master is pretty darned good, especially considering the price. Lovely, deep aromas of black cherry, tobacco, coffee and nutmeg, with a waft of vanilla-tinged oak introduce a wine that is ripe and sweet in the mouth.

It's not a keeper, however, and it won't improve in the cellar, but it's so good there's no reason not to drink it all up now.",,90,15.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,,,,Pinot Noir,Schug
150783,Chile,"Makes a strong statement for the potential of Chardonnay in Chile, with powerful toast and hazelnut aromas playing opposite fruit comprised of peaches and Granny Smith apples.

150790,US,"Always a bit herbaceous, this year the underlying leanness shows in rather green fruit, veering into bell pepper, dill, mint and oregano. All the oak in France and America can't really make the fruit any riper. But the oak does add smoky, creamy, vanilla notes and sweetness, too. There is some pretty fruit—notably blackberry—in the finish, but still, this is a wine of structure.

150796,US,"Made largely of Cabernet Franc, this wine has all the elements of first-rate Meritage: ripe blackberry and blueberry fruit, accompanied by a blast of smoky oak.

There's something almost Rhône-like in the opulence of its flavors, with chocolate, honey, brown-crushed spice and nectarines in a crisp wine with a long finish. It misses a few points because of a certain lack of complexity, but flavor freaks won't be disappointed by this jolting wine.",,88,15.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Pinot Blanc,Valley of the Moon
150809,US,"This is the workhorse release from an always dependable producer, and it's excellent. Not enormously complex or layered, but very ripe; it offers up-front peach flavors veering into tropical fruit, with a solid dose of smoky oak that adds nuance. Vibrant and alive, with high acidity that endows it with marvelous structure.",,88,18.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,,,,Chardonnay,Babcock
150810,Australia,"Deep cassis aromas, a touch of licorice, and menthol notes on the nose open to a palate of black-currant and cocoa flavors in this well-balanced, medium-weight wine. Nicely structured, it finishes with good length and moderate tannins; can be cellared a few years. Best Buy.",,88,11.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jacob's Creek
150811,US,"Not bad for this vintage, which has ended up thinner than originally thought. The grapes had to struggle to ripen, and you can taste the tension between greenness and sweetness. Quite a bit of oak adds charred, smoky, vanilla notes and a glyceriny sweetness. This is elegant stuff; not a big wine, but it is very well made and its pedigree is obvious.",,88,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Merlot,Stonegate
150812,US,"Ripe, muscular wine, with a full throttle nose rich with jammy black fruits. Firm structure, smooth tannins, and a chocolaty finish make this an appealing, consumer-friendly style.",Reserve,88,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Zinfandel,Stonehedge
150813,Chile,"Toasty oak, oodles of sweet fruit, and supple tannins are hallmarks of superconsultant Michel Rolland, and he has managed to bring them to the masses in this gently constructed Merlot. Bing cherries and toast, with mocha and herb shadings, are brought together with a deft touch.",,88,14.0,Rapel Valley,,,,,,Merlot,Lapostolle

150815,Chile,"Partial barrel-fermentation shows in this wine's hints of vanilla and cream, which marry smoothly with grapefruit and melon fruit. The grapefruit shades toward pink, particularly on the pleasantly crisp finish.",Terrunyo,88,29.0,Casablanca Valley,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Concha y Toro
150816,Chile,"A 75-25 blend that showcases the exotic lychee and pear aromas of Gewürz, while the Riesling asserts itself on the finish in a rush of bracing lime-like acidity. A unique blend that offers plenty of food-pairing versatility.",Don Miguel,88,11.0,Curicó Valley,,,,,,Gewürztraminer-Riesling,Miguel Torres
150817,Chile,"This evenly balanced Cabernet has a Bordeaux-like profile, with berry and cassis flavors, nicely integrated oak, and a mild herbal, bell pepper note. Shows good fruit for a 1998 wine and some attractive tobacco and earth shadings. Medium weight, it finishes nicely with moderate tannins and some spice-pepper notes. Drinks well now and may improve over two or three years.",Los Vascos Reserve,87,18.0,Colchagua Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)
150818,Chile,"Concha y Toro is making an effort to upgrade its entire lineup. This offering boasts copious weedy, chocolaty, black-currant aromas, followed by a soft, lush mouthfeel. It could use a bit more backbone, but this is a generously fruity wine ideal for early consumption.",Terrunyo,87,29.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Concha y Toro

150820,Chile,"Sure, cedar and chocolate are the dominant aromas and flavors, but there's enough blueberry fruit to stand up to the oak rather nicely. It doesn't hurt that the oak is high-quality stuff either, as the elements blend together in a harmonious whole. A little oaky, but shows a degree of finesse not often found in Chilean wines at this level.",Reserve,87,14.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Merlot,Santa Ema

150822,Chile,"This individualistic Chardonnay has a lot to offer. The nose is ripe, with floral, honey and even petrol notes and opens to a palate of tangerine and lychee nut-like flavors.

Reminiscent of some Alsatian whites and worthy of notice for its flavorful uniqueness.",,87,7.0,Maule Valley,,,,,,Chardonnay,Portal Del Alto
150823,Italy,"This unique red sparkler from Piedmont offers cherry and earth aromas before turning lighter on the palate, with slightly sweet strawberry flavors and a soft mousse.

150824,Italy,"This 100% Cortese wine has a slight fizz and an almost imperceptibly faint touch of sweetness. Hay and herb aromas open to grapy flavors accented by smoky notes.

150825,US,"Still dependable despite changes in ownership, this winery again delivers an elegant, well-made wine. With this vintage, it veers more toward herbaceous notes than fruity ones. The dominant flavors are of green olives and sweet bell pepper. Don't think, however, that it's lean. Oak provides fatness, and the right foods, like grilled red meat, will coax out the berry sweetness.",,87,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,William Hill Estate
150826,Chile,"A great price for a wine this rich and spicy. It's busting with ripe tropical fruit, peach, tangerine and pear notes, and spices, too.

Turns really pretty on the polished, spicy finish.",La Escultura Estate,87,10.0,Casablanca Valley,,,,,,Chardonnay,Errazuriz

150828,Chile,"Alejandro Hernandez, professor of viticulture and oenology at Chile's Catholic University, produced this attractive bottle of Chardonnay to drink tonight.

Offers a long apple-pineapple finish with a butterscotch finale.",Reserva,87,12.0,Central Valley,,,,,,Chardonnay,Portal Del Alto
150829,Chile,"What deep, supple flavors on this soft, delicious wine. The grapes obviously had no trouble ripening, and offer waves of blackberries, plums and black currants, not to mention spices like fennel and pepper. Very dry and fancy, this wine could sit on the best tables and not hang its head. Best Buy.",,87,8.0,Central Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Caliterra
150830,Chile,"A refreshing wine, with nicely ripened fruit and exceptional balance, that's pleasant in every way and a super value, too.  The fruit goes beyond citrus into more deeply flavored apricot and pear, and modest sur lie aging adds creamy, buttery notes.  This is a lovely wine and one of the best values of the year in Sauvignon/Fume Blanc.",La Escultura,87,10.0,Casablanca Valley,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Errazuriz
150831,US,"A rich, creamy wine, loaded with personality. Spicy, oaky aromas ride over tropical fruit and peach scents, and it drinks crisp and spicy, although the midpalate is a little thin in fruit. The oaky sweetness is very nice, and so is the whistle-clean finish.",Dutton Vineyard,87,22.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Fritz
150832,US,"Enough berry and plum richness and smoky oak to satisfy fussy drinkers, yet dry and compact, with a nice shine of acidity. Not too complex or subtle, but there's plenty to like about it. Should be easy to find with more than 30,000 cases produced.",,87,17.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Merlot,Kenwood
150833,Chile,"Hooray for the fruit on this beauty!  Gobs of freshly crushed blackberries, blueberries, plums, espresso, black currants and vanilla are charming, and the flavors are every bit as lush.  Technically, it's bone dry, but it's one of those wines that tastes fruity sweet.  It has elegance and style that belie the value price. Plus, the tannins are soft as velvet",El Decanso Estate,87,10.0,Curicó Valley,,,,,,Merlot,Errazuriz
150834,Chile,"A light and crisp Chardonnay that leans more to the style of Mâcon than Monterey. Mild apple, peach, tropical fruit and citrus notes on the nose open to a dry, slightly reserved palate with orange and spice elements. Bright acidity keeps it lively and it finishes dry with a classy, slightly chalky note.",Los Vascos,86,11.0,Colchagua Valley,,,,,,Chardonnay,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)
150835,US,"A little earthy, with plummy aromas accompanied by sun-dried tomato, rhubarb and hard spice notes. The flavors are along the same lines, with cherry tomato, coffee and spices. It's very dry, and finishes with a slightly dusty, tannic bite.",,86,28.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,,,,Pinot Noir,Talley
150836,US,"With this wine, Callaway takes a step away from its longtime Temecula appellation and toward the increasingly well-regarded Coastal designation. The wine is a little oakier than Callaway's previous bottlings and the fruit is lean, tending toward grapefruit and green apple. It's crisp and ultraclean, and a good value.",Coastal,86,10.0,California,California,California Other,,,,Chardonnay,Callaway
150837,US,"If you didn't know the price and had to guess, you'd probably figure this wine would cost about $18. It's enormously ripe and fruity, with bright peach, tropical fruits and spices and quite a bit of oak. The technical notes say it was partially barrel-fermented. A wine of enormous charm and a great value in Chardonnay.",,86,10.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Dreyer Sonoma
150838,Chile,"Slightly fat, figgy aromas, with notes of thyme and mint, give way to a round palate and flavors of citrus and fig. The mouthfeel has just a touch of youthful fizz, and the finish is long and nutty, with a reprise of herbs.",,86,9.0,Rapel Valley,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Lapostolle
150839,Chile,"Ripe berries, black cherries, earth, chocolate and herbs all mark this nose of this solid Merlot. Fairly full on the palate, it has a supple feel and plum and berry flavors. The finish is reserved, maybe even a bit austere, with dry, semisweet chocolate notes on the tart plum fruit.",Reserva,86,15.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Merlot,Cousiño-Macul
150840,Chile,"At this price, you can expect an honest, workmanlike everyday wine, and you get that here—along with other qualities that will surprise you. Not least is the fruit, nicely ripened and finely etched, and the spices that dance on the tongue. It's dry, of course, with fine acidity. What stands out is the depth of flavor.",,86,8.0,Central Valley,,,,,,Chardonnay,Caliterra
150841,Chile,"There's very juicy, jammy red berry fruit here and the round, even soft palate may lack a bit of structure, but this is a flavorful, very approachable wine. Slight tobacco and cocoa notes add interest and keep it from being just fruity. Cabernet flavors in a Beaujolais-weight package.",Los Vascos,86,11.0,Colchagua Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)
150842,Chile,"This is a very distinctive, even eccentric, Cab that must reflect its single-vineyard terroir.  The usual black-currant and blackberry notes are there, but the aroma is sharply dominated by an herbal streak, somewhat stalky or green, as if some of the grapes didn't ripen.  Tastes a little sharp.  Purists might want to age it for 3-5 years to see if it softens up.",Don Maximiano Founder's Reserve,86,30.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Blend,Errazuriz
150843,Chile,"Young and grapy, with plenty of heavily toasted oak, this is one Chilean red that could use a year or so to settle down. Right now the fruit is just too unformed and the charred oak too unintegrated, but the solid raw materials should knit together nicely in a relatively short time.",,86,9.0,Colchagua Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dallas Conté
150844,Chile,"Boasts a reasonably complex bouquet of chocolate, cedar and weedy cassis, followed by a mellow, soft palate impression. The fruit is sweet and direct, just the kind of thing that would hit the spot with an impromptu meal of steak frites. No, there's not a lot of structure, but why age a wine that's so clearly made for immediate gratification?",Estate Bottled,86,9.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Ema
150845,Chile,"Richly fruity and soft, this wine boasts loads of black-cherry and plum flavors. Clearly made from very ripe fruit, it lacks the herbaceous-vegetal character so often found in Merlot, but also any sense of structure. Finishes with a bit of alcoholic heat.",Xplorador,85,8.0,Rapel Valley,,,,,,Merlot,Concha y Toro
150846,Chile,"This is a well-made wine, correct in all respects but decidely light for a Cabernet Sauvignon, perhaps a reflection of the difficult 1998 (La Niña) vintage. However, its attractive flavor package and appraochable structure make for easy drinking with tonight's pasta or pizza.",Reserva,85,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Portal Del Alto
150847,US,"The nose seems lean and vaguely unripe. You get aromas of chocolate and green olives, and the most distant whiff of meat. Of course there's a great deal of oak, including American, which lends vanillin and smoky notes, but still an impression of leanness carries through in the mouth. It struggles to say the word “fruit.” It's also very tannic. That aside, it may soften and improve in time.",,85,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Merlot,Newlan
150848,Chile,"A good everyday Chardonnay, this wine's apple and toasted oak notes are supported by brisk acidity and a smooth but lively mouthfeel. The finish is pleasing and displays a nice butterscotch note",Reserva,85,11.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Chardonnay,Carmen
150849,US,"Cabernet Franc, used in Bordeaux blends and on its own in the Loire, is difficult to make into a complex wine in California.

It's a good wine, but on the simple side.",,85,32.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,,,,Cabernet Franc,Clos La Chance
150850,Chile,"Bright grapefruit and gooseberry aromas flesh out admirably in the mouth, with tart apple and citrus flavors moving to the fore. Finishes clean and crisp—a perfect partner for shellfish or fresh chèvre.",Santa Digna,85,12.0,Curicó Valley,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Miguel Torres
150851,Chile,"Loads of toasty oak, some mild cherry and plum mark this Bordeaux-style blend. The fruit is a bit lean, but the wine has appeal and is reminiscent of classic Rioja in weight and balance—not dense or extracted and maybe a touch woody, but still likeable.",Maxima Claret,85,21.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,La Playa
150852,US,"Aromas of sun-dried tomatoes, coffee, cinnamon, toast, blackberries and currants introduce a wine that drinks light and fruity.

Nothing to write home about, but nice enough for a dry red table wine.",,85,21.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Merlot,Dry Creek Vineyard
150853,Chile,"Jammy, soft and juicy, this Cabernet Sauvignon tastes almost like a California field blend. But that's not bad, if not particularly varietally focused.

150854,Australia,"The tangy grapefruit, lemon and pear notes on the nose carry over nicely to the palate.

150855,Chile,"Opening with a bouquet of red berries complemented by an earthy element, this Merlot offers more fruit on the palate, together with a spicy note. A medium-weight wine with decent acidity, it finishes dry, with more berry and earth notes.",,85,8.0,Rapel Valley,,,,,,Merlot,La Palma
150856,US,"White Merlot? Why not? It's actually a deep rose color, with fresh, exuberant aromas of raspberries and wildflowers.

150857,Chile,"Sweet caramel, a touch of mintiness, and some earth-tinged cassis grace the nose. That's followed up by simple fruit flavors and a corpulent mouthfeel held together by some light tannins on the finish.",,84,7.0,Maule Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Portal Del Alto
150858,US,"With a hefty case production, the wine is light and thin, but there are pleasant enough flavors. It's average Chardonnay, with just enough appley fruit, oak and sweetness to satisfy. It's clean and well-made, and there's not much more you can say about it.",,84,15.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Chardonnay,William Hill Estate
150859,US,"A blast of clean, ripe citrus, peach and pear fruit greets you from this well-made, if simple, wine. There are vanilla and smoke elements from wood. It's a little soft, and a tad off-dry, but if you need a case of something white to quench the throats of party-goers who aren't real particular, this is the ticket.",,84,6.0,California,California,California Other,,,,Chardonnay,Sutter Home
150860,Chile,"Not unlike this producer's 1999 Chardonnay Selection, this Gran Reserva's delivery is all at the beginning. Apple and toasted oak start things off and are followed by crisp acidity and a smooth mouthfeel, However, the finish is short and the oak somewhat overbearing.",Gran Reserva,84,15.0,Colchagua Valley,,,,,,Chardonnay,Château La Joya
150861,US,"From a dependable producer and a fine vintage comes a problematic wine. The fruit is nicely ripe and suggestive of apples and peaches, and it's balanced and dry. Acidity is adequate. The only jarring note is a strongly toasted character, almost like charcoal, which you can both smell it and taste. Even the finish is marred by this burnt flavor.",Reserve,84,16.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,,,,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois

150863,Chile,"Tropical fruit flavors abound throughout in this balanced, straightforward wine. Simple yet attractive, it can be used as an apertif or for casual dining. Spicy shellfish dishes, especially coconut shrimp, would pair well with this.",Reserva,84,13.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Chardonnay,Santa Rita
150864,Chile,"A light Chardonnnay showing  pineapple and pear aromas, and similar flavors that turn quite lemony on the palate.

150865,US,"Starts out with Cabernet-like aromas of black currants and an undercurrent of something leaner: unsweetened chocolate, anise, and smoky, oaky notes.

Which makes it a good Merlot value, even though the score isn't very high.",,84,10.0,California,California,California Other,,,,Merlot,Compass
150866,Chile,"With a bouquet of dark plum and toasty oak, with an earthy barnyardy note, this wine from this older Bordeaux grape still cultivated in Chile has medium weight and some plum and caramel flavors.

150868,Chile,"Sometimes you just need a cheap, quaffable, crisp dry white wine to drink in copious amounts, and this one will do just fine, thank you. It's citrusy, spicy, and dry, and has enough acid to cleanse the palate.",,84,8.0,Central Valley,,,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Caliterra
150869,US,"A clean, well made wine displaying Cab Franc's herbaceous, earthy, and spicy-floral side.

150871,Chile,"This wine, like so many from the 1998 vintage in Chile, is very light in texture and displays little depth.

150872,Chile,"Attractive and correct berry, plum and cocoa aromas open to a plummy palate, with a round mouthfeel. The cocoa and toast finish has easy tannins. Has all the right elements, but in a rather simple expression, wanting intensity.",,83,7.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Merlot,Undurraga
150873,US,"With a color akin to the soft pink of ripe peaches, this low-alcohol wine has aromas of peach, apricot, watermelon and vanilla.

Off-dry, it gives the impression of some sweetness.",White,83,7.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,,,,Zinfandel,Montevina
150874,Chile,"With 19% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a deeply flavored, youthful wine, precocious and sharp with acidity, and fresh as newly crushed grapes.

150892,US,"A light, earthy wine, with violet, berry and tea flavors and a sharp, herbal note verging on grassiness or wet hay. It's very dry and the tannins are soft, but crisp acidity keeps it lively in the mouth.",Coastal,82,10.0,California,California,California Other,,,,Merlot,Callaway
150893,Chile,"This light to medium weight Cabernet has the right profile, but just doesn't seem to come alive. The nose shows blackberry and tobacco aromas and in the mouth there are dried black cherry and spice notes, but they never shine. A soflty dry, slightly woody finish closes the package.",,82,11.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cousiño-Macul
150894,Chile,"An attractive bouquet of pear, orange-lime and floral notes opens this easy, round white. There's a hint of mint and plenty of citrus on the palate, but the fruit is touch too sweet low acid and the mouthfeel a bit fat. Lacks the spine we'd like to see in a top Riesling.",Doña Isidora,82,14.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Riesling,Cousiño-Macul
150895,Chile,"Strawberry and wet hay aromas give way to a sweet berry-flavored attack, but the wine turns tart and almost shrill on the finish. A green, stemmy sensation lingers in the mouth, along with dark coffee flavors.",,82,10.0,Casablanca Valley,,,,,,Merlot,Veramonte
150896,US,"Some raspberry fruit in the aroma, but things turn rapidly earthy and herbal, suggesting dried tomato, rhubarb and oregano. The flavors are simple and uninspiring. Soft, mild, rustic and thin are other words that come to mind.",,82,10.0,California,California,California Other,,,,Pinot Noir,Camelot
150897,Chile,"With a vegetal note, some cocoa and berry on the nose and its simple, rather flat flavor profile, this Cabernet suffers from both vintage deficiencies and over-oaking. Dry and woody on the back end.",Reserva,82,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Undurraga
150898,Chile,"A light and tart wine, with a bouquet of berry, tea and a touch of barnyard. On the palate, there's more cherry, tea and oak. The fundamental Pinot characteristics are here, but it turns drying and a bit sour on the finish.",,82,7.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Pinot Noir,Undurraga
150899,Chile,"Basic Cabernet Sauvignon, with all its goods up front. Opens with some nice cassis aromatics but there’s just not much on the palate. The finish is short and there’s a greenness to the fruit that reflects the tremendous difficulty of the 1998 vintage. Not up to previous efforts.",Medalla Real Special Reserve,82,15.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Rita
150900,Chile,"Aromas of freshly cut lumber, complete with some hints of burning sawdust, are joined by caramel and cassis. Medium to full on the palate, where some sweet fruit and oak flavors make a decent impression. There's a hint of alcohol poking through on the finish, but little else.",Prima Reserva,81,13.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,De Martino
150901,Chile,"Lavishly oaked, the fruit here struggles to make itself acknowledged, and when it does it is light plum-cranberry in aroma and flavor. Quite dry on the palate, the wine finishes tart with woody tannins.",Reserva,81,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Merlot,Undurraga
150902,Chile,"This medium weight Chardonnay offered aromas of overripe pineapple and citrus with an odd note somewhere between citrus and varnish. The apple and mild citrus flavors lack vitality, and turn overly tart on the finish.",Estate Bottled,81,10.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Chardonnay,De Martino
150903,Chile,"Very light berry and mint aromas open this austere, dry Cabernet. The fruit is dark, but needs more depth and profile to carry the woody presence here.",120,81,7.0,Rapel Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Rita
150904,Chile,"A lot of Chilean Cabernets seem to have a distinct weediness to them; this is a perfect example of the style, boasting green hay and herb aromas over subdued—almost stewed—cassis fruit. Some tart acidity keeps things lively on the finish.",,81,10.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,De Martino
150905,Chile,"There's not much point in making a reserve-style wine if the barrels are subpar. Aggressive menthol and sappy green-barrel aromas and flavors dominate this wine. There's good weight and texture, just not much in the way of vinous flavor.",Prima Reserva,80,13.0,Maipo Valley,,,,,,Merlot,De Martino
150906,France,"This lovely wine, a Monopole, is already showing complex, forward fruit with flavors of plum, cherry and cranberry. Soft and fulsome, it shows a light hand with the oak, allowing nuances of tobacco and leather to emerge. Good weight and texture, it seems bound for early glory.",Clos des Reas,93,65.0,Burgundy,Vosne-Romanée,,,,,Pinot Noir,Michel Gros
150907,France,"Rion holds back on the new oak, letting the pure, supple fruit speak for itself. This is a muscular Vosne, young and firm, showing excellent focus and structure. Already the finish lingers beautifully, with layers of texture and tightly wrapped fruit. Should cellar well for a decade or more.",Les Beaux-Monts,92,52.0,Burgundy,Vosne-Romanée,,,,,Pinot Noir,Daniel Rion
150908,France,"Another premier cru from Michel Gros, this one not as elegant and fruity as the Réas. Instead it goes for more ripeness, more tannic weight, and a lot more roasted scents from the barrels. Big, rawboned but undeniably appealing, it has a lot of rough-hewn flavor, dominated by toast, tannin and tobacco.",Aux Brulees,90,65.0,Burgundy,Vosne-Romanée,,,,,Pinot Noir,Michel Gros
150909,France,"This is a lovely, fragrant Burgundy, with a smoky/cherry scented nose leading into a rather tight, hard young wine. Hints of rosewater, graham cracker and tobacco are there, along with some green tannins. Medium body and texture; needs more time to show its best stuff.",Clos dea Argillieres,89,52.0,Burgundy,Nuits-St.-Georges,,,,,Pinot Noir,Daniel Rion
150910,France,"Scents of graham cracker and malted milk chocolate tickle the nose, while the tart fruit slowly unwinds to reveal cherry and beetroot scents and flavors. Tannic and hard, without immediately showing much sweetness, it seems to put the emphasis on mineral and soil, root and leaf, but may evolve into a very interesting wine.",,89,38.0,Burgundy,Chambolle-Musigny,,,,,Pinot Noir,Michel Gros
150911,France,"This needs a good bit of breathing time, then it begins to reveal some cherry lifesaver fruit and a balanced structure with firm acids and medium tannins. A bit chalky in the finish, it's a relatively light style that is pleasant and pretty once it has opened up.",Les Chaliots,87,37.0,Burgundy,Nuits-St.-Georges,,,,,Pinot Noir,Michel Gros
150912,France,"The nose is dominated by the attractive scents of new French oak, with some hints of pipe tobacco and just a whiff of volatile acidity. It is tight and tannic, a bit ""lifted"" with the VA, and at this point not showing much fruit or complexity, given the price.",Les Charmes,87,65.0,Burgundy,Chambolle-Musigny,,,,,Pinot Noir,Daniel Rion
150913,France,"Inky and rustic, yet in a refined manner. This is knock-out juice if you like ’em big and flavorful. The full bouquet of grape, raisin, oak, licorice and herb aromas pulls you in and the follow-up palate of dense blackberry flavors with herb and smoke shadings fulfills the promise the nose makes. Loads of oak here, but there’s great depth of fruit for it to play against. A definite keeper; hold for three or four years at least.",,94,30.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,,,,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Le Vieux Donjon
150914,US,"Old-gold in color, and thick and syrupy. The aromas run to caramel, apricots, toffee, butterscotch, vanilla, pecan pie and crème brûlée. Tastes as voluptuous as it smells. Fantastic concentration and depth; a nectar bursting with sweet, gorgeous fruit. The acidity is high, but it feels soft and creamy. Residual sugar of 28% makes it tooth-achingly sweet. Only 554 cases produced, but worth the search.",Late Harvest Cluster Select,94,25.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,,,,White Riesling,Navarro
150915,US,"Decades ago, Beringer’s then-winemaker Myron Nightingale created an artificial method of introducing the botrytis to Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc grapes, with great results. This splendid version has strong aromas of crème brûlée, vanilla custard, honey, apricot purée and a warm note of peach pie fresh out of the oven. The taste is, in a word, fabulous. This is a nectar fit for the gods.",Nightingale,93,30.0,California,North Coast,North Coast,,,,White Blend,Beringer
150916,US,"An impressive wine that presents a full bouquet with bready, leesy, toasty aromas, and intriguing lemon and caramel hints. The palate sports attractive fruit and spice flavors that are both complex and lovely, if a challenge to define. There’s a long full finish to this top-notch American sparkler.",J. Schram,93,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,,Champagne Blend,Schramsberg
150917,France,"Light and elegant, this spicy, lively wine is a gentle joy. There is a precision and refinement evident here that makes other Champagnes seem almost clumsy. The delicate flavors of fresh apple, pear and citrus are further enhanced with pretty cinnamon spice.",Brut Mosaïque,92,30.0,Champagne,Champagne,,,,,Champagne Blend,Jacquart
150918,France,"Jacquart makes a full-bodied, ripe style of Champagne, with tiny, effusive bubbles. Flavors of slightly overripe apples lead into a mature palate with hints of oxidation. Sherry, nuts, olive oil, vanilla and other less identifiable nuances meld into a rich, ripe, satisfying and complex whole.",Cuvée Mosaïque,92,38.0,Champagne,Champagne,,,,,Champagne Blend,Jacquart
150919,France,"This classy example opens with a very floral nose and almost flower-shop aromas. But it’s not at all sweet on the palate, as tangy lime quickly moves to the fore. Impressively light and elegant, it displays some unusual elements and has a fine bead as well as a supple, herb-tinged finish.",Cuvée President,91,37.0,Champagne,Champagne,,,,,Champagne Blend,H.Germain
150920,Italy,"Rich and mature aromas of smoke, earth and herbs announce this surprise. The palate offers complex fruit, herb and mineral notes, and while mature, it has great mouthfeel and acidity. The dry finish has length and shows a reprise of the smoke and mineral elements from before. Best Buy.",Brut Riserva,91,19.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,,,,,Champagne Blend,Letrari
150921,France,"Shows some older notes: a bouquet of toasted white bread, cinnamon, brown sugar and smoky yeast, with just the slightest hint of white pepper. Really rich and complex, with supple lime flavors offsetting the earthy impression. Very dry, with an overall excellent palate impression. Should continue to age and grow finer.",Blanc de Blancs Brut Mosaïque,91,38.0,Champagne,Champagne,,,,,Champagne Blend,Jacquart
150922,Italy,"Made by 30-ish Roberta Borghese high above Manzano, which also happens to be the chair manufacturing capital of Italy, this is a perfect example of how good Tocai can be. The aromas are honey and grapefruit-orange. After an intro of crisp acidity, the same flavors appear and persist on the medium body. Match this one with a good seafood risotto.",Superiore,91,,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,,,,Tocai,Ronchi di Manzano
150923,France,"Rich and toasty, with tiny bubbles. The bouquet is laced with honey and vanilla scents. The palate suggests nuts and toast, without any noteworthy sweetness despite the demi-sec label. There’s good concentration and a ripe, toasty, slightly oxidized, nutty finish. This would work perfectly with the usual Champagne food suspects: foie gras, triple-cream cheeses and pâté, though it’s probably not the best choice for oysters.",Demi-Sec,91,30.0,Champagne,Champagne,,,,,Champagne Blend,Jacquart
150924,France,"Really fine for a low-acid vintage, there's an intriguing nose here with white pepper, sandalwood and pine-nut elements. There are mature notes to the apple, toast and pepper flavors, good backbone, and the texture is just lovely. This well-developed example still has youthful elements, and closes with a grapefruit-mineral finish that is both relaxed and complex.",Diamant Bleu,91,70.0,Champagne,Champagne,,,,,Champagne Blend,Heidsieck & Co Monopole
150925,Italy,"Many people feel Fiano represents southern Italy’s most promising white grape, and after tasting this rendition, who can argue? The flavor package is pineapple, citrus and wet stones. The structure and mouthfeel are what many Italian whites strive for but never reach. An elegant wine.",,91,20.0,Southern Italy,Fiano di Avellino,,,,,White Blend,Feudi di San Gregorio
150926,France,"Offers an intriguing nose with ginger, lime and floral elements. The mouthfeel is ephemeral—almost too light—but there’s a good case to be made for this style when bubbles are involved. Green apple, an almost lilac note, and lime on the palate. Finishes nicely, too.",Cuvée Prestige,91,27.0,Champagne,Champagne,,,,,Champagne Blend,H.Germain
150927,Italy,"This classic example comes from a cru vineyard called Terre di Dora, which is named after the Mastroberardinos’ mother. They should all be proud of this one. Wet stones, apples, peaches and pears start it off. On the palate, the structure and mouthfeel are nearly perfect. The finish features the butterscotch tones of malolactic fermentation. A wonderful example of what Fiano di Avellino can be.",Terre di Dora,91,20.0,Southern Italy,Fiano di Avellino,,,,,White Blend,Terredora
150928,France,"A perfect salmon shade, with scents of peaches, cherries and toast. It hits the palate with big, ripe, fresh fruit: crisp apples, peaches, cherries and citrus. Concentrated and full, with a tart, fresh back end that lingers into a cherry-vanilla finish.",Grand Brut Rosé,90,52.0,Champagne,Champagne,,,,,Champagne Blend,Gosset
150929,Italy,"More Pinot Grigios should taste like this. A rich pear-like nose is followed by crisp acidity, a medium body and a viscous mouthfeel. The finish is long and redolent of pears and citrus. And all for $15!",,90,15.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,,,,Pinot Grigio,Alois Lageder
